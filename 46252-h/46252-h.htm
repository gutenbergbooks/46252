<div>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Fred la Mothe was speaking. After a certain
number of beverages composed of Scotch
whisky, imported soda, and a cube of ice, it was a
matter of comparative ease for him to exhibit a
notable fluency. After two o’clock in the afternoon
Fred was generally fluent.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘’Tain’t safe,’ I says to him. And the wind was
blowin’ enough to lift the hair out of your head.
‘I wouldn’t go up in the thing for the price of it,’ I
says, ‘and, besides, you’re seein’ two of it. Bad
enough drivin’ a car when you’re lit up,’ I says, ‘but
what these flyin’ machines want is a still day and a
man that’s cold sober. You just let it rest on its
little perch in the bird-cage.’”</p>

<p class='c004'>Fred refreshed his parched throat while his four
companions waited for the conclusion of the tale.
“‘You’ll bust your neck,’ I told him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘Ten to one,’ says he, ‘I round Windmill Point
Light and come back without bustin’ my neck.
Even money I make it without bustin’ anything,’
says he.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘Dinner for four at the Tuller to-night that the
least you bust is a leg,’ I says, and the wind whipped
the hat off my head and whirled it into a tree.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Fred stopped, evidently mourning the loss of his
hat.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said Will Kraemer, impatiently, “what
happened? Did he go up?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“<em>Him?...</em> I paid for that dinner, but, b’lieve
<em>me</em>, there were times when I thought I’d have to
collect from his estate. Ever see a leaf blowing
around in a gale? Well, that’s how he looked out
over the lake. Just boundin’ and twirlin’ and
twistin’, but he went the distance and came back
and landed safe. Got out of the dingus just like he
was gettin’ off a Pullman. Patted the thing on the
wing like it was a pet chicken. ‘Let’s drive down
to the Pontchartrain,’ he says. ‘Likely the crowd’s
there.’ Not another darn word. Just that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Trouble with Potter Waite,” said Tom Watts,
“is that he just naturally don’t give a damn. If
he’s going to pull something he’d as lief pull it in the
middle of Woodward Avenue at noon by the village
clock as to pull it on the Six Mile Road at midnight.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No pussy-footin’ for him,” said Jack Eldredge.
“My old man was talking about him the other night.
Day after he cleaned up those two taxi-drivers out
here in front. ‘Don’t let me hear of you running
around with that young Waite,’ he says. ‘He’s a
bad actor. You keep off him.’”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’s a life-saver,” Fred La Mothe joined in.
“When dad lights into me I just mention Potter,
and dad forgets me entirely. You ought to hear dad
when he really gets to going on Potter.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m no Sunday-school boy—” said Brick O’Mera.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do tell,” gibed Eldredge.</p>

<p class='c004'>“—but I’ll say Potter is crowdin’ the mourners.
<em>I</em> wouldn’t follow his trail a week steady.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The others waggled their heads acquiescently.
Even to their minds Potter Waite traveled at too
high speed and with too little thought of public
opinion. About that table sat five young men who
were as much a result of a condition as outlying
subdivisions are the result of a local boom. Of them
all, La Mothe came from a family which had known
moderate wealth for generations, but it had grown
swiftly, unbelievably, during the past few wonderful
years, to a great fortune. Of the rest, Kraemer and
O’Mera were the sons of machinists who, a dozen
years before, would have considered carefully before
giving their sons fifteen cents to sit in the gallery at
the old Whitney Opera House to see sawmill and pile-driver
and fire-engine drama. The automobile had
caught them up and poured millions into their laps.
Eldredge was the son of a bookkeeper who, fifteen
years ago, had drawn fifty dollars at the end of each
month for his services. For every dollar of that
monthly salary he could now show a million. Watts
was the son of a lawyer whom sheer good luck had
lifted from a practice consisting of the collection of
small debts, and made a stockholder in and adviser
to a gigantic automobile concern. And these boys
were the sons of those swiftly gotten millions. They
had forgotten the old days, just as Detroit, their
home city, had forgotten its old drowsiness, its mid-Western
quietness and conservatism.</p>

<p class='c004'>One might compare Detroit to a demure village
girl, pleasing, beautiful, growing up with no other
thought than to become a wife and mother, when,
by chance, some great impresario hears her singing
about her work and it is discovered that she has
one of the world’s rarest voices. From her the old
things and the old thoughts and the old habits of
life are gone forever. The world pours wealth and
admiration at her feet and her name rings from continent
to continent. So with the lovely old city, straggling
along the shores of that inland strait. She has
become a prima donna among cities. The old identity
is gone, replaced by something else, less homely,
but mightier, grander. Her population, which, within
the memory of boys not out of high-school, numbered
less than three hundred thousand souls, was now reported
to be thrice that, and, by the optimistic, even
more. Her wealth has not doubled or trebled, but
multiplied by an unbelievable figure, and she has
spent it with unbelievable lavishness.</p>

<p class='c004'>Where once were cobblestone pavements and
horse-cars are countless swarms of automobiles;
where once were meadows, pastures, wood-lots, are
tremendous plants employing armies of men, covering
scores of acres, turning out annual products
which bring to the city hundreds of millions of dollars.
In the history of the world no city has come
into such a fortune as Detroit, nor has there been
such universal prosperity, not to employer alone,
but to employees, and to the least of employees. It
seemed as if the day had arrived when one asked,
not where he should get money, but what he should
do with his money. So Detroit spent! It built magnificent
hotels; it created palaces for its millionaires,
and miles upon miles of homes—luxurious, costly
homes for those whose handsome salaries passed the
dreams of their youth, or whose fortunes, built up by
contact with the trade of purveying automobiles to
an eager world, had not even been hoped for ten
years before. Even the laborer had his home. Why
not, when one manufacturer paid to the man who
swept his floors the minimum wage of five dollars a
day?</p>

<p class='c004'>That was before the war, before a solemn covenant
became a scrap of paper and the world fell sick of
its most horrible disease. Then Detroit was rich,
was spending lavishly but not insanely. With the
coming of war there was a halt, a fright, a retrenchment,
a hesitation, for no man knew what the next
day might bring. But as the next day brought no
disaster, as it became apparent that the coming days
were to bring something quite different from disaster,
Detroit went ahead gaily.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then came strangers from abroad, speaking other
languages than ours, and men began to whisper that
this plant had a ten-million-dollar contract from
Russia for shrapnel fuses; this other plant a twenty-million-dollar
contract for trucks; this other a fabulous
arrangement for manufacturing this or that bit
of the devil’s prescription for slaughtering men—and
the whispers proved true.</p>

<p class='c004'>The automobile brought amazingly sudden wealth;
munition manufacture added to it with a blinding
flash—and Detroit came to know what spending was.</p>

<p class='c004'>These five young men, sitting in mid-afternoon
in the Hotel Pontchartrain bar, were a part of all
this; their life was the result of it; the thoughts, or
lack of thoughts, in their minds, derived from it
inevitably, remorselessly. They were castaways
thrown up in a barroom by a golden flood.</p>

<p class='c004'>To four of them a nickel for candy had been an
event; now, without mental anguish, each of them
could sign a dinner check which stretched to three
figures, or buy a runabout or a yacht, or afford the
luxury of acquaintance with the young woman who
stood fourth from the end in the front row.</p>

<p class='c004'>Let them not be chided too harshly. The fault
was not theirs wholly, but was the inevitable result
of their environment. They played at work, drew
salaries—but could spend their afternoons in the
Pontchartrain, in the Tuller, on the links or at <em>thé
dansant</em>. They knew no responsibility to man, felt
but a hazy responsibility to God, and as for their
country, they had never thought about its existence.</p>

<p class='c004'>They talked of the war, were pro-Ally with the
exception of Kraemer, whom they baited when the
fit was on them. Kraemer had been born on Brady
Street. His grandfather was a ’forty-eighter. It
was natural that he should see eye to eye with the
land from which he derived his blood. Of them all,
he alone took the war with seriousness, so they
baited him at times, and he raged for their amusement.</p>

<p class='c004'>They began the sport now.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If the Kaiser only had the grand duke,” said La
Mothe, “he might stand some show. Look what
he’s done and what he had to do it with! I don’t
figure it’ll last much longer. Everybody’s lickin’
Germany.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Kraemer banged the table. “You’ll see,” he said,
passionately. “The war would be over now if it
wasn’t for the <em>neutrality</em> of the United States. This
country’s just prolonging the agony. If it wasn’t
for the munitions the Allies get from here, we’d be
in Paris and London and St. Petersburg. Devil of a
neutrality, ain’t it? Look here....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Rats!” said O’Mera. “Where’s Potter, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Haven’t seen him to-day. Ought to be driftin’
in.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’s over at police headquarters,” said a new
voice, and Tom Randall beckoned a waiter and sat
down at the table.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pinched again?” came in chorus.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, but he’ll probably get himself pinched before
he’s through with it. Know the von Essen girl?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hildegarde, you mean? Sassy one? Swiftest
flapper that ever flapped?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s the darlin’. Well, she drives that runabout
of hers down Jefferson again, doin’ nothin’
less than forty-five and makin’ real time in spots.
Seems she’s been fined pretty average regular. Well,
traffic cop gets her and makes her haul up to the
curb and crawls right in beside her. Uh-huh. And
off they go to the station, her lookin’ like she could
bite off the steerin’-wheel. Well, Potter and I are
comin’ along in <em>his</em> car, and we see the excitement
and tag after. You know Potter?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We do!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘It’s that von Essen kid, isn’t it?’ he says to me,
and I agree with him. ‘She’s been caught too regular,’
he says. ‘They’ll be nasty. Better trail along
and see if we can help out.’ So we did. Got to the
station simultaneous and adjacent to them, and out
jumps Potter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘Afternoon, Miss von Essen,’ says he.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘Mr. Waite,’ she says, cool as a <em>bisque tortoni</em>.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘Pinched?’ says he.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘Ask him,’ she says, and jerks her head toward
the cop, who is clambering down.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘She is,’ says the cop, ‘and this time she gits
what’s comin’ to her. She been a dam’ nuisance,’
he says, ‘and this here time I’m goin’ to put her over
the jumps. Git out and git inside,’ he says to her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, Potter sort of edged up to the cop and
looks him over and says, ‘I don’t really see why this
young lady has to go inside. You can make your
complaint, and that about ends your usefulness.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘She stays,’ says the cop, ‘and if I got anything
to say about it, she sleeps on a plank.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘You wouldn’t care to do that, would you, Miss
von Essen?’ says Potter, with that grin of his, and I
made ready to duck, because when he grins that
way—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We know,” said the boys.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘Now you listen to reason,’ says Potter. ‘A
police station is no place for a young lady. It doesn’t
smell pleasantly. So she doesn’t go in. If bail’s
necessary or if anything’s necessary, I’m here for
that. But omit the stern policeman part of it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘Git out and come in,’ says the cop to the girl.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘You and I are going in, friend,’ says Potter,
and he took hold of the policeman’s arm. ‘<em>We’ll</em>
fix this up—not the young lady. Come <em>on</em>,’ says
Potter, with his left fist all doubled up and ready.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The cop knew Potter, so they parleyed, and then
they walked under the porch—you know the entrance
to the station—and in a couple of minutes out
comes Potter, looking sort of sneering and shoving
a roll of bills into his pocket.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘Seems there was some mistake,’ he says to Miss
von Essen. ‘It wasn’t <em>you</em> who broke the speed ordinance;
it was I. I’ve arranged the mistake with the
officer. Now, for cat’s sake, cut it out. You’ll be
breaking into print <em>good</em> one of these days, and there’ll
be the devil to pay ... or breaking your neck.
You’ll get yourself talked about if you don’t ease off
some.’ And,” said Randall, “he hardly knows the
girl. Some line of talk for Potter to ladle out!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What did she say?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Her eyes just <em>glittered</em> at him. She’s a handsome
little cat, but I’ll bet she can scratch. ‘Coming
from <em>you</em>,’ she says, ‘that advice is <em>thrilling</em>.’ Her
engine was still running. She slammed into gear,
stepped on the gas, and <em>shot</em> over to Randolph
Street.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Potter looked after her and chuckled. ‘Promising
kid,’ he said. ‘You chase along, Tom. They
want me inside.’ So here I am. Guess he can take
care of himself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here he comes,” said La Mothe. “Didn’t get
locked up, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A tall young man who did not need padding in
the shoulders of his coat was making his way between
the tables. He wore a plaid cap jauntily on his yellow
hair. He was not handsome, but at first glance
one was apt to call him handsome—if he were in
good humor. You liked his face, except at times
when he was alone, or thoughtful. Then it distressed
you, for you could not make out the meaning of its
expression. Then his blue eyes, which were twinkling
now, looked dark and brooding. He had a way of
looking dissatisfied—and something worse, more disquieting—something
not to be defined. Ordinarily
his face was such as to draw men to him, even older
men who quite disliked him and used his mode of
life as a text for dissertations on what the young man
of to-day was coming to.</p>

<p class='c004'>One thing might be said with safety—he possessed
personality. When he was one of a group he dominated
it. He was not a boy to leave out of the
reckoning.... When one of his “fits,” as his
friends called them, was dark upon him, even those
who knew him best and regarded themselves as closest
to him were a bit uneasy in his company. The
most hardy and reckless of them was moved at such
times to go away from there, for Potter Waite usually
set out on some mad enterprise when that mood was
on him. He would set a pace few cared to follow.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You never know what he’s thinking about,”
Kraemer said, frequently. It was true. But you
did not know that he <em>was</em> thinking, and that he could
think. Also he never followed, he <em>led</em>. For him consequences
did not exist. If he set out to do a thing,
he did it, and let consequences take care of themselves.
And, as the boys complained, he went his
reprehensible way with a brass band. The idea of
concealing his escapades seemed not to occur to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’ll you have?” called Randall, whose waiter
had come to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A stein, a quart of Scotch, and a bottle of soda,”
said Potter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s that, sir?” said the waiter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Deliver it as ordered,” said Potter, with a boyish
smile that got him quicker and better service than
other men’s tips.</p>

<p class='c004'>The waiter obeyed and the boys watched with
interest. Potter poured a generous half-pint into
the stein upon the ice, and filled the stone mug with
soda.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m goin’ to <em>git</em>,” said Jack Eldredge. “Somethin’s
goin’ to bust loose around here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter sat back comfortably and sipped from his
stein. He appeared unconscious that, from other
tables, glances were directed toward him, and that
men standing at the bar mentioned his name and
pointed him out to companions. He began chatting
pleasantly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not pinched, eh?” asked Randall.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Suppose I’ll get mine in the morning,” Potter
said, without interest.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’d ’a’ let her take her medicine,” Randall said.
“It wasn’t any of your funeral.... Didn’t even
say thank you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter looked at him musingly. “That was the
best part of it,” he said, presently. “Sort of proves
she’s being natural; not four-flushing like some of
these girls. They’d have burbled and kissed my
hand—stepped out of character, you know. She
didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A boy came into the room with an armful of papers.
What he called could not be heard distinctly above
the din of the place. Potter raised his hand and the
boy threw a paper before him. The young man
glanced at it, seemed to stiffen. He sat back in his
chair while the others watched him, arrested by something
in his manner, something portentous.</p>

<p class='c004'>He stood up and looked from one to the other of
them. Then he laid down the paper slowly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The <em>Lusitania</em> has been torpedoed,” he said, in
a quiet voice, “without warning. Hundreds of
Americans are lost—women and children.” He
stopped and repeated the last words. “Women and
children.” For a moment he stood motionless....
“It means war,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Every eye was on him. He held them. He stopped
them as if they had been so many clocks with their
hands pointing to this fateful hour. He made them
feel the event.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nobody spoke. Potter turned very slowly and
surveyed the room, then, still very slowly, he walked
out of the room without a word or a nod. His stein
was left, scarcely touched, before his chair.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Potter Waite stood a moment at the curb
beside his car, looking at the heart of this great
new city. At his right, Cadillac Square stretched
broadly away to the County Building’s square tower.
Within his memory this handsome space had been
a public market, unsightly, evil of odor, reeking with
decaying vegetables and the refuse of the meat-stalls.
To-day it was overcrowded with parked automobiles.
At his left opened the Campus Martius,
bisected by the magnificent width of Woodward
Avenue. There, on its little irregular plot, squatted
the City Hall, shabby, slatternly, forbidding. It
seemed, against the background, the palisade, of upreaching
sky-scrapers of terra-cotta and brick, to
typify that thing we tolerate as municipal government.
As was the shabby building to its clean, its
magnificent, neighbors, so was the thing it contained—the
government of a great city—to the governments
of private enterprises which had made that
city a place to excite the envious admiration of her
sister municipalities.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter frowned at the thought. The huge machine
of government was made up of such parts, of
common councils, of mayors, of state legislatures, of
national legislatures, differing only in degree, but
wrought of kindred materials. It was this machine
with which the country would make war.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It won’t work,” Potter said to himself. “It
hasn’t the stroke or the bore....”</p>

<p class='c004'>He stood still looking at the teeming Campus,
following its currents and cross-currents and eddies
with eyes darkened by thought. It was a current
worthy to pass between magnificent banks. The
sidewalks eddied with never-motionless men and
women; with human beings whose errands hurried
them on. Potter studied them with interest. Their
faces were mobile, alert, intelligent, forceful. There
was a capability about each individual; there was
something distinct about each atom in the crowd....
Here, after all, was the great machine of government.
Here was that from which government
derived; here was that which would make war,
which would <em>fight</em> the war. Walking down that street
was a potential army, and the mothers of a potential
army.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was these who had made possible, who had
created, the terra-cotta sky-scrapers; it was these
who had made possible that marvelous procession of
automobiles which taxed the width of Woodward
Avenue; it was these who had made possible the
building up of that miracle of industrial life that
stretched around the town like fortifications around
some European city—but fortifications holding the
city safe, not from a foreign invader, but from an
economic invader. Factory-fortresses preserving the
prosperity of the town.</p>

<p class='c004'>He continued to eye the crowd, and his eyes became
less deep and dark. He raised his head without
knowing that he raised it. A feeling of pride was
upon him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here’s the thing—the real thing,” he said within
himself. “This is the machine; the stroke is there
and the bore is there ... if they can be made to
see and to understand.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter stepped into his car and drove out Woodward
Avenue, and thence down a side-street to that
mammoth, unbelievable mass of buildings which all
the world, through advertisements, would recognize
as the plant of the Waite Motor Car Company.
Since the day the first brick was laid, a dozen years
before, building had never ceased. The plant had
never caught up with itself, had never been able to
produce the number of automobiles required of it
by the public. As far as the eye reached were clean,
splendid structures; the ragged outline at the end,
dimly seen, was caused by steel not yet covered by
brick, by brick walls rising to wall in new space in
which to manufacture yet more thousands of the
Waite motor-car.</p>

<p class='c004'>To all this, to this concrete, visible, tangible fortune,
Potter Waite was sole heir. It was not like
wealth in stocks, bonds, securities. It was not in
promises to pay, in paper standing for something
more substantial. It was <em>there</em>. It could be beheld
in the mass. Perhaps a hundred millions of dollars
actually reared themselves in brick and steel, in splendid,
efficient machinery. Potter had grown up with
it, was accustomed to it. Unlike the casual passer-by,
he was not awed by it.</p>

<p class='c004'>He leaped from his car and ran up the broad flight
of stairs leading to the offices on the second floor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dad in?” he flung at the man who sat behind
the information-desk.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, but he’s occupied, Mr. Waite. I shouldn’t
go in.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter strode past. The man rose as though to
call him back, and then sat down with a shrug.
Potter flung open the door of his father’s office,
flung himself through it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dad, have you heard?” he said, abruptly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Fabius Waite looked up, frowned. “I’m busy.
Weren’t you told?” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter glanced at the other occupants of the room;
recognized Senator Marvel, did not recognize the
other. He nodded to the Senator.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The Germans have torpedoed the <em>Lusitania</em>,”
he said. “It was without warning. More than a
hundred Americans drowned—women and children
... like rats,” he finished.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Senator was on his feet. The news had been
a sudden, bewildering blow to him. “What’s that?
Are you sure? Where did you get it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter threw a paper on the desk over which the
Senator and the stranger crouched with manifest
excitement. Not so Fabius Waite. He did not
glance at the paper, nor did he seem moved. His
broad, clean-shaven, patrician face showed no emotion
except, perhaps, a shade of irritation at the
others’ reception of the tidings. Potter said to himself
that his father would sit outwardly unmoved,
unruffled, not in the least disarranged mentally, if
word were brought him that the dissolution of the
universe had commenced. It was true. Fabius
Waite would study the information and determine
his course of action before he gave a sign that the
most sharp-eyed might read.</p>

<p class='c004'>“My God!” exclaimed the man whom Potter did
not know.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’ll it mean?... What will it mean?” the
Senator asked, in an awed, frightened voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What can it mean but war?” Potter said.</p>

<p class='c004'>His father merely glanced at him, not contemptuously,
not rebukingly, in fact, not as if Potter were a
human being at all, but as if he were some piece of
the room’s furniture to which attention had been
called.</p>

<p class='c004'>“When you men are through scrambling over that
paper,” he said, quietly, “I’ll look at it myself.”
He did not stretch out his hand for the paper, did
not seem to suggest that it be given to him, but
simply stated a fact. Potter came near to smiling at
the alacrity with which Senator and business man
abandoned the news sheet and pressed it upon his
father. The Senator was a big man in Washington
and in Michigan, Potter knew. The stranger looked
like a man of importance, yet Fabius Waite dominated
them, made their personalities colorless by
the simple fact of his presence. He merely sat there—and
they were dwarfs beside him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The people,” said the Senator, “there’ll be no
holding them back. They’ll sweep us into war—as
they did with Spain.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I heard there were munitions shipped on the
<em>Lusitania</em>,” said the stranger.</p>

<p class='c004'>Fabius Waite paid not the minutest attention to
them, but read calmly, appraisingly, from beginning
to end what the paper told of the sinking of the
<em>Lusitania</em>. When he was done he folded the paper
neatly and laid it on his desk.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There were munitions,” said the Senator, “and
people were warned by advertisements in the paper
to keep off that boat.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the difference?” Potter demanded. “Are
we going to let them murder our citizens like this—and
put up such an excuse as that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Citizens had no business on the boat,” said the
stranger. “They brought it on themselves.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s <em>got</em> to be war,” said Potter, his eyes
traveling uncertainly from Senator to business man—to
his father, where they remained. “There’s no
other way. What else can be done about such a
thing?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“For one thing,” said Fabius Waite, coolly, “we
can stop jabbering and think about it.... You
especially, Potter. If you must wag your tongue,
go back to the Pontchartrain bar and wag it for
the benefit of the gang of loafers you train with....
Senator, what suggests itself to you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I must get to Washington. The Senate doesn’t
want war, I can vouch for that.... But the people....
Perhaps the President can hold them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I gather from your words that he’ll be willing to
try?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’s the last man in the country to want war....
There’ll be no war. Those German dunder-heads!
Do they want to pull the whole world down
about their ears?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They’re fools,” said the stranger.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We won’t argue about their wisdom. Whether
they were wise or foolish, they seem to have sunk
the <em>Lusitania</em>.” Fabius Waite paused. “And when
all’s said and done it won’t be the Senate nor the
President nor business which determines what we
will do about it. It’s the people who will make up
their minds. Don’t lose sight of that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Public opinion can be molded.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“For a while and to an extent.... I believe this
thing can be handled so that nothing will come of it.
It will take careful handling. You agree with me, do
you not, Senator, that neither the people nor the
business of the Middle West want war?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Certainly I do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have no doubt you will intimate to the President
that you have grave doubts if the Middle
West will follow him into war—will back him up in
any belligerent attitude he may have in mind to
assume.” Fabius Waite’s eyes were on the Senator’s
face, and none could tell what thoughts stirred behind
them. He did not order, did not direct, did not
suggest, but he was imposing his will on this imposing
member of an august body as surely and as relentlessly
as if he held a revolver at the Senator’s head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I feel it my duty to intimate as much to him,”
said the Senator.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There must, of course, be a protest,” said Fabius
White. “News that the President is preparing a
note to the German government will hold the people
in check. I incline to believe they will wait for it
to see what the President thinks.... If it should
take time to prepare, so much the better. It would
give the country time to cool off.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The people have seen what war means,” said the
Senator. “They’ve seen Belgium and France....
They’ve no stomach for a dose like that. Handle
this thing <em>right</em>—let them get over the first shock of
it—and the excitement will die down. The people are
sheep.... Yes, you’re perfectly right about delay.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter had hurried to his father, his soul a flame of
emotion. The flame was being quenched. The boy
stood silent, looking from one to the other of these
men, hurt, amazed. Just why he had come or what
he had expected his father to do he did not know.
Impulse had brought him. The word patriotism
was not in his vocabulary, as it was not in the vocabularies
of millions of Americans on that seventh
day of May. But some spring had been touched,
something had been set in motion by the news of
that atrocity which would be heralded from one end
to the other of the Germanic Empire as a splendid
feat of arms. The thing was <em>wrong</em>: the evil of it
had seared through to the uneasy soul of the boy and
had set afoot within him something which he did
not understand as yet.... He was not able now
to say, “<em>Civis Americanus sum</em>.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was not reason that had brought him. It was
no conscious surge of loyalty to his country. It was
something—something he felt to be <em>right</em>. Perhaps
there was a tinge of adventure in it; perhaps his
youth heard the rolling of martial drums and saw
the unfurling of flags of war.... But he was right
and these men were wrong. That he knew.</p>

<p class='c004'>He wondered at the men. There had been no word
of sympathy for the dead; there had been no cry
of anger wrung from them by this affront to the honor
of the nation; there had been but one thought—dollars.
Business came first. The prosperity of
dollars and cents filled their minds to the exclusion of
all other prosperities. Even the Senator, servant
and representative of the people, was not serving
and representing the people. He, too, saw only the
effect of this thing on business.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Does everybody think like this?” Potter wondered.
It might be so. His friends at the table in the
Pontchartrain bar had been surprised at the news,
but he considered their actions those of men who had
not been shocked or those of men enraged. Perhaps
they, too, were of one mind with his father.... Perhaps
<em>all</em> the people were of that mind. Perhaps that
was the sort of people the American nation had grown
to be....</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dad,” he said, “if Mother had been on board—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“She wasn’t,” said Fabius Waite. “Senator, this
is mighty ticklish, and it will grow more ticklish.
This one act can be smoothed over, but many recurrences
of it cannot be smoothed over. Isn’t there
some machinery to set afoot forbidding American
citizens to cross the ocean? That would do it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wouldn’t care to introduce such a resolution,”
said the Senator, “but probably somebody can be
got to do it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ve a <em>right</em> to travel,” Potter said, hotly.
“Didn’t we fight a war about that once? You don’t
mean to say, Dad, that you actually would have
this country admit that it was afraid to claim its
rights.... The world would laugh at us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let it,” said his father. “Another year or two
of this war and this nation will top them all. We’ll
be the financial rulers of the world. We’re getting
there now, and nothing must happen to set us back.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And the world will despise us,” Potter said, bitterly.
He was beginning to see more clearly now. He
paused. This attitude of mind he was witnessing
could not be common to all the people. He would
not believe it. “Dad, think <em>bigger</em>. You men are
wrong. You can’t head this off. It means <em>war</em>....
It’s got to mean war. And war means armies
and cannon and shell—and aeroplanes. We’ve got to
have them all. Think, Dad, and you’ll realize it....
Take a telegraph blank, Dad, and write the
President. You can help with this plant; every
other plant like it can help. Wire the President that
this plant is at the disposal of the country for any
use the country can put it to.... Tell him you’re
with him. Tell him you can make guns or shrapnel-cases
or motors for him as well as for England
or France or Russia—as you are making them....
And aeroplanes. We’ll need thousands of
them.... Give that job to me, Dad. I know
aeroplanes—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You know mixed drinks and chorus girls and traffic
cops,” his father snorted.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You won’t do it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t be a fool.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter turned and walked out of the room. He
stopped at the information-desk. Here sat a man
who worked for wages, a common citizen. Here sat
the sort of man who made up the bulk of that crowd
he had watched on Woodward Avenue.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dickson,” he said, “the Germans have sunk the
<em>Lusitania</em> and killed a hundred Americans.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Awful, wasn’t it? I just heard.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What are we going to do about it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why—we’ll make ’em pay for it, that’s what.
We’ll collect damages, millions of dollars.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“<em>Money?</em>” said Potter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You bet, Mr. Waite. Money.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is that all? Will that satisfy you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Isn’t that enough?” asked Dickson, in real surprise.
“What more can anybody ask?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You don’t want to fight? You don’t think it
means war?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Great heavens, no! War!... We don’t want
any of that in ours. I guess this country won’t mix
in any wars. We’ve been seeing what war means.
Anyhow, what should we fight for? England and the
Allies are going to lick Germany, aren’t they? Well,
let them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter turned on his heel. He had his answer.</p>

<p class='c004'>Once more he got into his car and whirled down-town.
Once more he stopped before the Pontchartrain
and entered the bar. His friends were not there,
but he sat down at a table and ordered a drink; he
ordered another drink—and another....</p>

<p class='c004'>His eyes were dark and brooding; the restless urge
to recklessness was upon him—that smoldering fire
which had made him a young man to be looked upon
askance by the respectable. His face was set—and
he drank.... Fred La Mothe came through the
revolving door, saw Potter, studied his face and his
attitude for a moment, and then quietly withdrew.
He knew the signs, and had no desire to be in Potter’s
company from that hour on.</p>

<p class='c004'>He sat alone at his table, brooding, drinking from
time to time. He felt no hunger, did not arise to eat.
The lights came on and still he sat. The room was
thronged with the early-evening crowd, and Potter
glowered at them—and ordered other drinks.</p>

<p class='c004'>Presently he stirred uneasily; the spirit of unrest,
of recklessness was working within him, urged on by
liquor. He pushed himself to his feet, and stood, not
too steadily, and his eyes seemed to flame as he
glared over the crowd. His face seemed to flame, to
be kindling from some fire that surged up from depths
inside him. His yellow hair, brushed back from his
brow, added to the flamelike semblance of him.</p>

<p class='c004'>He struck the table with his fist and a glass
danced over the edge to smash on the floor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s a hell of a country,” he said, loudly, “and
you’re a hell of a lot of men....”</p>

<p class='c004'>The room fell silent, and every face was turned
toward him. He glared into the upturned eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’re a lot of crawling, sneaking, penny-chasing
rabbits,” he said, distinctly. “Brag and blow—that’s
you.... And then somebody kills your wives and
babies and you haven’t the guts to kill back again.
You’re afraid, the lot of you. You won’t fight. If
anybody says war you crawl under the table....
Americans!... I’d rather be an Esquimo.... If
anybody slapped your faces you wouldn’t fight....
I’ll show you. I’ll show you what kind of cattle
you are.... Now, if there’s a fight in you, come
and fight....”</p>

<p class='c004'>He lunged forward and struck a man, upsetting
him against a table. The place was in an uproar.
“It’s young Waite—look out. He’s a bad actor....
Call the cops.” Potter swayed forward into
the throng at the bar, striking, striking. In a moment
he was the center of a maelstrom of shouting,
scuffling men—and his laugh rang above their
shouts. They struck at him, clutched at him; waiters
and bartenders tried to force their way to him.
He was pushed back and back, still keeping his feet,
still lashing out with his fists, his eyes blazing, his
yellow hair rumpled and waving, his reckless laugh
dominating the turmoil. His back was against the
wall. Before him now was a clear semicircle which
none ventured to cross, and he laughed in their faces.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fifty to one,” he jeered, “and you’re afraid.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A couple of policemen shouldered their way
through, recognized Potter, and stopped. “Cut it
out now, Waite,” said one of them. “Cut it out and
come on.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter’s answer was to step forward and strike the
officer with all his strength. The other officer did
not parley. His night stick was out. He raised it,
brought it down on Potter’s yellow hair, and the
whole room heard the thud of it.... Potter stood
erect the fraction of a second, then the stiffness
went out of his body and he sank to the floor a shapeless
heap....</p>

<p class='c004'>The morning papers printed Potter’s picture and
news stories of this his most reckless escapade. They
also printed moral editorials which, with singular
unanimity, pointed out facts concerning young men
with too much money, no regard for their citizenship,
and mentioned disgracing an honorable name.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>When the heir to a hundred millions of dollars
is arrested in this country for any act less
than murder, he does not expect to sleep in a cell.
The police do not expect him to sleep in a cell, and
the public would be astonished—and a little vexed—if
he were compelled to do so. They would be vexed
because in the event of his detention, they would
be deprived of the pleasure of railing against our
institutions and of saying to their neighbors in the
street-car that, “a man with enough money can get
away with anything.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Couldn’t you bring in a kid without usin’ the
wood?” the lieutenant at the desk said to the officer
who had floored Potter. It did not seem fitting to
that lieutenant that a hundred millions of dollars
should have its scalp abraided by a night stick.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Kid, hell!” said the officer. “If you’d ’a’ seen
the wallop he handed Tom!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter clung to the edge of the desk, dizzy, swaying,
his head not clear between blow and drink.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here,” said the lieutenant, “come in here and
lay down. Want I should telephone anybody—or
git a doctor?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” said Potter, sinking on the lounge and
closing his eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>The lieutenant went out and called the superintendent
on the telephone. “Got young Waite here,”
he said. “He tried to tear the Pontchartrain up by
the roots and Kerr had to drop the locust on him a
bit. What’ll I do wit’ the kid?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hurt?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Didn’t improve him none.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Drunk?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So-so.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Send somebody over to the Tuller with him and
have him put to bed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was not for the public to know that the superintendent
had two sons who were employed in the
Waite Motor Car Company’s plant—for whom he
desired fair prospects and promotion.</p>

<p class='c004'>So Potter slept in an excellent hotel bedroom instead
of a cell. He awakened in the morning with a
head that was very sore; dressed and went down to
the office.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your car is out front,” said the clerk. Even that
detail had been attended to by a solicitous police force.</p>

<p class='c004'>At breakfast he read a paper on whose first page
he divided honors with the <em>Lusitania</em>. He was not
interested in what was said about himself; at first
he was not especially interested in what was said
about the <em>Lusitania</em>, but as he read his interest grew,
changing to hot anger as he read the still incomplete
list of the dead. More than one individual was
there named with whom Potter had broken bread.</p>

<p class='c004'>Even in the editorial there was no demand for
war; there was astonishment, there was wrath, but
it seemed to Potter there was some effort to find an
excuse for Germany’s act.... Passengers
warned.... Munitions.... Possibility of internal explosion....
Wait for particulars. The attitude of the
paper was not quite his father’s attitude, not so
frank, but he was able to see it was his father’s attitude
disguised for popular consumption. And he was
intelligent enough to realize that the finger of that
paper was on the public pulse; that, without doubt,
the paper was dealing with the situation as the public
wanted it dealt with—a public not willing to resent
blow with blow.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the next table a man was saying, “Just because
they’ve killed a thousand or so is no reason for us to
get into it. War would mean killing another hundred
thousand or maybe half a million. Because
they’ve killed a thousand, should we let them kill a
hundred times as many more? That’s <em>sense</em>....
Make ’em pay for it....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What could we do, anyhow?” asked the other.
“Might get in with our navy, but there isn’t anything
for a navy to do. Couldn’t send an army
across three thousand miles of ocean.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Right. I’m for the Allies, but my idea is we can
help a lot more by staying neutral and sending ’em
all the munitions they want.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“My idea exactly,” agreed the other.</p>

<p class='c004'>That was it. What could we do? We had no army.
Potter had been told that Uruguay had more artillery
than the United States. There was no ammunition!...
The United States was ready for peace, and
the old absurdity about a million squirrel-shooters
was gospel in the minds of a hundred millions of
people. A million squirrel-shooters armed with what?</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter got up from the table and went out to
his car. He wanted to be alone; he wanted fresh air;
he wanted to work off the various uncomfortable
sensations that possessed him. He drove recklessly
out Jefferson Avenue to the Country Club. At this
hour it was deserted save for servants. It would
do him good, he thought, to play around alone, without
even a caddy, so he donned flannels and shoes,
and carried his caddy bag to the first tee.</p>

<p class='c004'>Somebody else was teeing off—a girl. Potter did
not glance at her, but dropped his bag with a clatter
and sat down on the bench to wait till she should get
out of his way.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How do you do?” said the young woman.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter stood up automatically. “Good morning,
Miss von Essen,” he said, without interest.</p>

<p class='c004'>She turned her back on the ball she had been
about to address and walked toward him, slender,
graceful, yellow hair blowing out from beneath a
tilted tam-o’-shanter. Her face was thin, not especially
pretty at first glance, but arresting. The
features were distinct, and the expression, even in
repose, was one of eagerness—such an expression as
one associated with the possession of wit and daring.
The expression was akin to pertness, but was not
pertness. One knew she could play golf or tennis.
One knew she had been a tomboy. One knew she
had temper. Her whole appearance and bearing
were a perpetual challenge. “Come on,” it seemed
to say. “Whatever it is, if there’s a chance to take,
let’s do it.” Potter knew she was a girl about whom
there had been shakings of the head, not so much
because of what she had done as because of what
she might do. Conservative mothers preferred some
other friend for their daughters—and you felt immediately
that Hildegarde von Essen delighted to tantalize
such matrons and to set their tongues clacking.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You gave away something yesterday that you
needed yourself,” she said, with directness.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” said Potter, amused as at a pert child. She
was only nineteen. “What was it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Advice. ‘You’ll be breaking into print <em>good</em> one
of these days, and there’ll be the devil to pay,’”
she quoted. “‘You’ll get yourself talked about if
you don’t ease off some,’ says <em>you</em> to <em>me</em>.” The effect
of it was of a naughty child thrusting out her tongue.
“And you take your sanctimonious air right away
to the Pontchartrain and drink too much and get
into a dis-<em>grace</em>-ful fight, and get arrested, and break
into print <em>good</em>. I s’pose,” she said, thoughtfully,
“you were jealous—afraid I might steal some advertising
and crowd you out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter laughed, a good, whole-hearted, boyish
laugh. The sort of laugh one likes to hear. “It was
funny, wasn’t it?” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Impertinent, <em>I</em> call it,” she said, sharply.</p>

<p class='c004'>He laughed again. “If you want advice on any
subject, you go to an expert, don’t you? Well, I’m
an expert on breaking into print and getting myself
talked about. My advice is worth something. I
ought to charge for it.... Now there’s a notion.
How would it do for me to open an office with a sign
on the door, Expert Advice on Wild-oats Farming—Years
of Experience?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You seem proud of it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, I’m not exactly proud of it. I’m not like
little girls who do things for effect.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She turned her back and marched to her ball, but
before she was ready for the stroke she faced him
again. “You’re just a naughty little boy throwing
paper wads in school,” she said, sweetly, “and you
think you’re a grown man being <em>devilish</em>.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Eh?” he said, a bit startled. On the face of it
she had merely uttered a saucy, childish gibe, but
Potter was struck by it. He tucked it away in his
mind for future reference. There were elements of
shrewdness, of insight, of <em>truth</em> in it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have a puppy who chewed up my best slippers—because
he hadn’t anything else to do,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do your friends, by any chance, hint that your
tongue is sharp?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>She made no reply, but her driver whistled viciously
through the air in a practice stroke.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll tell you what,” he said, “just to show you
I’m forgiving I’ll let you play around with me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She looked at him an instant. “I’ll give you a
stroke a hole,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Eh?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve seen you play,” she said, calmly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Drive,” he said, with a chuckle. “I ought to
put up a cup, oughtn’t I?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Make it a ride in that aeroplane thing of yours,”
she said. “I’ve always wanted to see how it felt
to fly. Not just go up and come down, but a regular
fly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not a chance. Your father would assassinate
me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You haven’t much confidence in your game, have
you? To beat a girl who gives you a stroke a hole.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’d both break into print. Can’t you see it
in type? ‘Hildegarde von Essen explores the firmament
with Potter Waite,’ with some account of your
career with number of fines for speeding, and references
to myself. Not nice.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fiddlesticks! We shouldn’t have to invite any
reporters....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But they’d hear about it. They always do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A stroke a hole,” she jeered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very well. Give me a beating and I’ll take you
flying.” He felt confident enough, for he played a
fair game of golf.</p>

<p class='c004'>His confidence decreased after the first hole was
played. He outdrove her and had the distance of
her, but her every stroke was down the center of
the course; she never overestimated her strength,
and avoided trouble. On the green she holed a
twelve-foot putt—and the hole was hers.</p>

<p class='c004'>He settled down to play his best. The thing became
not merely a game of golf between a man and
a girl. It seemed to him that more was at stake
than victory or defeat in a pastime. He became interested,
intensely interested. He wanted to win
and he played to win.... And he watched the
girl. <em>She</em> interested him. She was so utterly natural,
so without pose, yet so very different from the
ordinary run of girls, particularly nineteen-year-old
girls. There was a <em>tang</em> about her. It was as if one
were eating bread and all unexpectedly encountered
some unidentified, some palate-intriguing spice.
That defined her for Potter. If he had been going
to describe her he would have said she was highly
spiced.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter played better than usual, but at the end of
the ninth hole he was two down. They had talked
little. Now she sat down.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Tired?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not the least,” she said, “but I find I play the
last nine better if I sit here a few minutes and get
the first nine out of my mind.... Had you any
friends on the <em>Lusitania</em>?” She asked the question
suddenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If I were a man—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you were a man—?” he repeated after her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’d enlist. I wouldn’t wait for this country to
go to war. I’d go across. A good many boys have
gone, haven’t they? I’d go across and be an aviator—or
anything they’d let me be....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“For the Allies? I took it for granted you would
be on the other side of the fence.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pro-German!” Her eyes flashed. “I leave that
for Father and his cronies. I believe they <em>celebrated</em>
last night—actually. My mother wasn’t German,”
she said. Potter knew Mrs. von Essen had died two
years before. “<em>I know Germans</em>,” she said, presently.
“I ought to; I’ve lived among them all my life....
Sometimes I think the whole race is a button
short.” Potter was to learn that in her vocabulary “a
button short” meant not quite complete mentally.
“I like some of them, and I’d even trust some of
them, but most of them are arrogant <em>beasts</em>....
I’ve read their books,” she said. “Dad has a lot of
them. People used to think they were nice, slow,
harmless, fat, good-natured. Maybe some of them
are. But I believe that’s what the German government
<em>wanted</em> the world to think.” These were
unusual words to hear falling from a girl’s lips. She had
been <em>thinking</em>. Perhaps that had happened in her
life which made her think. “Will we declare war?”
she asked, in her sudden way.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Last night I was sure we would. To-day I’m
almost as sure we won’t.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She nodded. “People don’t realize.... But
we’ll be in it,” she said. “No matter how much we
try to stay out, they’ll force us in. They’ll sink another
<em>Lusitania</em> and another and another, until we
<em>have</em> to come in. You’ll see.... Partly because
they don’t understand—and partly because that’s the
kind they are. You know a German never understands
anybody but a German. They can’t. Just
before Mother died she said to me, ‘Garde’—she
always called me Garde—‘don’t marry a German,
honey. Nobody but a German woman should marry
a German.’ And Mother ought to know, oughtn’t
she? I’d rather marry a <em>Chinaman</em>,” she said, suddenly
becoming girlish again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If we have war, what will all the Germans in
this country do?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Talk loudly till war is declared. Then shut up
and do sneaky things. Nothing in the open....
I think,” she said, slowly, evidently trying to set
aside prejudice and cling to fact—“I think most of
them will be loyal. In spite of their talk, I don’t
believe most of them would care to live in Germany
and in German conditions. That’s why. But there’ll
be enough.” She got up quickly and teed her ball.
“Let’s go on,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hildegarde played the same steady game as before;
Potter’s mind was on other things. Somehow
he believed this girl was right; that she read the
future truly. The sinking of the <em>Lusitania</em> meant
war—sooner or later it meant war.... And the
country was unready for war. It did not want to
get ready for war.... She had spoken about going
across to fight with the Allies. He considered that.
It was a thing he was to consider for days and weeks
to come. But that was a makeshift. He realized it
was a makeshift. There must be something better,
something more logical than that.</p>

<p class='c004'>He won a hole and halved a hole in the last nine.</p>

<p class='c004'>“When do we fly?” she asked, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I shouldn’t have promised.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But you did.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He nodded. “Whenever you wish.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let’s see. Suppose we say next Tuesday.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“My car is here. Can I drive you home?” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I was to telephone for my car. Yes, you may.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A limousine was just entering the grounds of the
von Essen place in Grossepoint when Potter and
Hildegarde reached the drive.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s Father,” she said, and her lips compressed
a trifle.</p>

<p class='c004'>A big man who looked not unlike Bismarck, and
who endeavored to heighten the likeness, alighted
and stood beside the car, looking toward them. It
was obvious he was waiting for them. Potter stopped
his car and lifted his cap. Herman von Essen scowled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Since when are you friends with this young
man?” he demanded. “Out of that car and into the
house. Have you no sense—to be seen in public
with this man whose picture is in the papers? For a
girl to be with him is to lose her reputation.... And
you”—he turned on Potter furiously—“take your
car out of my grounds. Never speak with my daughter
again. Do you hear? You are a drunken young
ruffian.” He launched himself into a tirade of great
circumstantiality.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter’s eyes were dark with the brooding expression
which his friends counted a signal of danger, but
he remained motionless, save to turn toward Hildegarde.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am sorry, Miss von Essen,” he said. “I
shouldn’t have brought you. I might have foreseen—”</p>

<p class='c004'>She smiled. It was not a bright smile, but a reckless
smile, as reckless as one of Potter’s own might be.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thank you for coming.... I hope we shall be
friends.” She did not glance at her father, but
walked erectly up the steps and disappeared in the
house. Von Essen continued verbally to chastise
Potter, who did not look at him. Perhaps he did not
dare, fearing the weakness of his self-restraint. The
young man threw his car into gear and moved away,
leaving von Essen gesticulating behind him.</p>

<p class='c004'>He drove to his own house, a mile beyond. Before
he reached there the brooding darkness was gone
from his eyes; they twinkled. He was thinking of
Hildegarde.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Detroit was flying high; it was spending as
few cities have ever spent. Wealth poured in
upon her, and men who, ten years before, had worried
when they heard their landlady’s step on the
stairs were building palaces in the midst of grounds
for which they paid fabulous sums for each foot of
frontage. No clerk or school-teacher was too poor
to own a lot in a subdivision, laid out with sidewalks
and shade trees, miles beyond the city’s limits. Overnight
land increased in value, so that fortunate ones
who paid ten dollars down on a lot sold their equities
within the month at profits of hundreds of dollars.
Men bought distant pasture-land for a song and sold
it for an opera. The streets were full of tales of
this man who had made a hundred thousand dollars,
of that man who had cleared sixty thousand, of men
by the dozens whose bank-accounts had increased
more modestly, but still by thousands. Land that
had gone begging at ten dollars a foot was eagerly
sought at a hundred dollars.... This was a by-product
of that great manufactory of wealth, the
automobile.</p>

<p class='c004'>As for it, and its growing sister, munitions, one
believed whatever was told, and the tale fell short
of the truth. One manufacturer filled the banks
with his deposits, and, when they refused to accept
more, was obliged to build his own bank.</p>

<p class='c004'>When money flows in torrentially it washes away
walls of economy. Detroit spent as it earned—lavishly.
It was just completing what is perhaps
the most magnificent clubhouse in the United
States—a million-dollar plaything, the money for
which had been raised almost in an hour. It was the
new Detroit Athletic Club, outgrowth of that historic
and honorable old athletic club which had so
long been a landmark on Woodward Avenue when
land was cheap and a quarter-mile cinder track and
football-field might be maintained in the heart of
the city. Five thousand men were found instantly
who could afford this luxury.</p>

<p class='c004'>Magnificent new hotels sprang up miraculously;
department stores, surprised in their inadequacy by
the multiplication of population, were adding annexes
treble the size of the original stores. Everybody
owned a motor-car.... The cabaret moved
westward and found a welcome in a town once
famous for its staidness. The handling of motor
traffic became a greater problem for the police than
the protection of the city from crime. And yet people
scarcely realized what was happening. They
took it as a matter of course—and flew high with the
city.</p>

<p class='c004'>Across the ocean another type of highflyer was
coming into prominence. One might say the war
had passed through its second phase. The first
phase was the phase of fighting-men, of armies, of
obtaining soldiers with rifles. The second phase was
the artillery phase, the high-explosive phase. Each
for its months filled the papers and demanded the
interest of the world.... Now was approaching
the third, the aeroplane phase. It was beginning to
overshadow the other two in public estimation.
Aeroplanes were no longer contraptions which one
went to the country fair to watch performing tricks.
They had come into their own. They ranked as a
<em>necessity</em>. They had emerged from the cloud of obscurity
which hung low over the battle-fields, and
men were made to realize that victory in the air
meant victory in the fields below....</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter Waite had thought much of this, had hoped
for it, had even ventured to prophesy it. One might
say he was deeply interested in highflying of both
sorts.</p>

<p class='c004'>A certain fascination which mechanics held for
him since childhood had enabled Potter to finish a
turbulent college career with a mechanical-engineering
degree. This, or what it represented, he had
never put to use except in the way of a pastime.
But aeronautics interested him. He was so fortunate
as to be rich enough to play with aeroplanes,
to fly aeroplanes, to own and experiment with aeroplanes,
and there was something about the risk of
it, the romance of it, the thrill of it, the novelty and
the miracle of it, that fitted well into the recklessness
of his unsatisfied nature. So he had been one of the
country’s earliest amateur aviators. The part taken
by the aeroplane in the Great War had quickened
that interest, solidified it. It had become something
more than the fad of a rich young man to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was during the week that followed the sinking
of the <em>Lusitania</em> that Potter was introduced to a
Major Craig, of that then comparatively unknown
branch of the United States military machinery
known as the Signal Corps. It was at the Country
Club, and Potter, who was seldom drawn to an individual,
felt something much akin to boyish admiration
for the slender, trim, uniformed figure of the
young major. Craig was young for a major. He
might have been forty, but a well-spent man’s life
made him appear younger. He had not the face we
have taken as typical of our soldier, but rather the
softer, gentler features of the enthusiast—not the
sharp, hungry look of the fanatic. He was a man with
one compelling interest in life, a man bound to his
profession, not by duty, but by love. Something of
this was apparent at a glance. It became plain upon
acquaintance. There was something about him—not
the uniform he wore—but a subtle characteristic
which set him apart from the run of men. He was
distinct. After half an hour’s chat with him Potter
perceived that the major was something wholly outside
his experience, and he was interested. He was
interested in the major’s conversation, in his appearance,
but chiefly in that peculiar something which
made Craig different from La Mothe or Kraemer or
O’Mera. The others who had gathered about the
table wandered off upon the links and left Potter and
the major alone.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are the Potter Waite who has done something
in the flying way, are you not?” asked the
major.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A little.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wish,” said the major, enthusiasm fighting in
his eyes, “that there were ten thousand of you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There are people around this town,” Potter said,
laughingly, “who wish there were one less.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The major did not join in Potter’s laugh, but regarded
the young man shrewdly, appraisingly—with
something of sympathy and understanding in his
eyes. He got to his feet abruptly. “I should be
obliged, Mr. Waite,” he said, “if you would play
around with me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Presently they were equipped and walking toward
the first tee.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mr. Waite,” said the major, “have you ever
considered the possibility that this country might
be compelled to enter the war?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” said Potter, and the major saw that darkening
of his eyes, that sullen, restless, forbidding expression
which came at times over the boy’s face.</p>

<p class='c004'>The major laid his hand on Potter’s arm. “You
have been disappointed in us, is that it? You thought
the country would flare into righteous rage over the
<em>Lusitania</em> and go knight-erranting? Is that it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Didn’t you?” Potter countered, a bit sharply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am not permitted to express opinions,” said
the major, simply. “You wanted immediate war
because you are young and easily moved. Perhaps
because you have not thought deeply what war
means. I take it you are impulsive.... Have you
asked yourself <em>why</em> you want war? Was it mere resentment?
That isn’t an excuse for war. Was it the
adventure of it? Or was it possibly something bigger
and deeper? What do you think of the United
States, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter did not reply immediately. What <em>did</em> he
think about the United States? He did not know.
As a matter of fact, he had done very little thinking
about the United States; had rather taken the
United States for granted. Somehow he felt embarrassed
by the question.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you perhaps <em>love</em> your country?” asked the
major.</p>

<p class='c004'>From another man Potter might have regarded
this question as a symptom of mawkish sentimentality.
From the major it seemed natural, unaffected,
as if the major had the right to ask such a question
and have a plain answer. Craig waited for Potter
to answer, his face grave, gentle; his bearing sympathetic.
Potter felt the sympathy, felt that he and
this officer could grow to be friends.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why,” said Potter, presently, “I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The major nodded his head. “I’m afraid that’s the
way with most of us—we don’t know. We’re thinking
about ourselves and our businesses and about
making money and passing the time. We have
grown unconscious of the country just as we are unconscious
of the air we breathe. That’s hardly a
state of mind to carry us into war, is it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” said Potter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Because war requires love of country,” said the
major. “Not the love of country that orators talk
about on July Fourth, but the kind of love that is
willing to prove itself. War, Mr. Waite, means sacrifices
such as we do not even dream of. It means that
love of country must take place over everything
else. Not a stingy loyalty, but a real <em>love</em>—the sort
that gives life and everything one possesses to the
country. Mr. Waite, if we should go to war to-morrow
and your country should come to you and
say, ‘I want your life. I want everything you possess
in the world—wealth, comfort, place. I need
<em>everything</em> to win this war,’ what would you say?
Would you give willingly and gladly? I mean what
I say literally.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter stopped and faced his companion a moment
in silence. “Could you?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think I could,” said Craig. “I think my country
means all that to me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That you will have to find out for yourself. I
can’t teach you patriotism, love of country, in half
an hour, nor in a course of twenty lessons. I couldn’t
teach you to love a woman. Each man must find
those things for himself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I suppose so,” said Potter, uneasily, and they
walked along together in silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ve heard a great deal about military preparedness
lately,” said the major, presently. “It’s in
my mind that we need another sort of preparedness
even more. There <em>is</em> such an emotion as patriotism,
Mr. Waite, but it seems to be dormant in this people.
A couple of generations of ease and prosperity and
peace have lulled it to sleep. We have grown careless
of our country, as we sometimes grow careless of
our parents. But I believe patriotism is here—more
than we need universal military training, more than
we need artillery and ammunition and war-ships, we
need its awakening. We can never have one sort of
preparedness without the other.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I had never thought about it,” said Potter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Will you think about it, Mr. Waite? And when
you have thought about it, see if you don’t find it
demanding something of you.... Do you know
that an army without aeroplanes is like a blind man
in a duel with a man who sees? Think about that.
I sha’n’t tell you how many ’planes we have, nor
how many trained aviators. It would shock you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know something about that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But have you realized that if events force us
into this war we shall need, not hundreds of ’planes,
but thousands—possibly twenty-five thousand?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter was astonished at the number. “Really?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That many will be absolutely necessary, and the
best and fastest ’planes that can be had. Where
will we get twenty-five thousand of them?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“God knows,” said Potter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mr. Waite, the War Department is not sleeping.
Will it surprise you to know that I came to Detroit
solely to have this talk with you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“With me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We know all about you, and about every other
amateur aviator in the country. <em>All</em> about you,” the
major repeated.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m surprised you found it worth your while to
come, then,” Potter said, with, a trace of bitterness.</p>

<p class='c004'>“For instance,” said the major, “we know what
happened in your Pontchartrain Hotel the night the
<em>Lusitania</em> was sunk.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter flushed angrily, but made no reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The manner of it,” said the major, quietly, “was
regrettable. The impulse behind it—and we looked
for that impulse—was hoped to be something not
regrettable. I came to find out that and other
things. I have not come to offer advice, Mr. Waite, merely
to get information valuable to our country....
Had you thought you might be valuable?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“General opinion seems to hold the opposite
view.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was the major’s turn to remain silent. He
watched Potter’s face keenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you want of me?” Potter asked,
finally.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What would you do if war came?” countered the
major.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Enlist, I suppose. As an aviator, if I could.
I’ve been thinking of going to France, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s adventure,” said the major. “And as for
enlisting, would you be most valuable there or here—helping
to produce those twenty-five thousand
’planes? Think that over.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you believe we shall be in it?” asked Potter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know,” said the major. “But I do know
that the man who goes ahead as if he were sure
we shall will be doing the thing he should do. You,
for instance, might think aeroplanes, plan aeroplanes,
dream aeroplanes—fighting-’planes.... Shall we
play around now?”</p>

<p class='c004'>They played around, for the most part in silence,
for Potter was following the major’s direction to
think. In the locker-room and in the shower-baths
they did not allude to the matter of their conversation,
and when they came out on the piazza of the
club they found themselves in the midst of a party
of younger members talking the sort of talk that is
generally to be heard on country-club piazzas and
drinking as if that were the business of their lives.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hey, Potter,” called Jack Eldredge, “come over
here and meet a pilgrim and a stranger—also state
your preference.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The major touched Potter’s shoulder. “Think it
all over,” he said, and turned away.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter walked to Eldredge’s table, and Jack presented
him to a young man in his early thirties who
stood up and shook Potter’s hand warmly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mr. Cantor, Mr. Waite,” said Jack. “Mr.
Cantor came this morning from New York. Friend
of the Mallards and the Keenes. Goin’ to be around
Detroit quite some time—so I put him up here, of
course.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mr. Eldredge was very kind indeed,” said Cantor.
“I have hoped to meet you, Mr. Waite. I
have letters to you from Mr. Welliver and Mr. Brevoort.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They sat down and Potter observed the stranger.
He was dark, smooth of face save for a carefully
shaped, slender mustache. His features were rather
thin, but quick with intelligence. There was a hint of
military training in his shoulders. It appeared he
had recently come from abroad, and soon was talking
fluently and entertainingly about his experiences on
the fringe of the zone of war. Potter wondered what
his nationality might be. At first he fancied the
accent was of Cambridge, but there was another hint
of accent underlaying the careful enunciation of
the Cambridge man. Potter made the guess that
Cantor had been born to some tongue other than
English, but had, probably, been educated in one of
the English universities. This supposition was proved
later to be correct.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I represent an investment syndicate,” said
Cantor to Potter, presently. “They have sent me over
to study the situation here, particularly the automobile
industry. I seem to have come to the place to
do that thoroughly,” he added, with an attractive
smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Detroit suffers with the automobile-manufacturing
habit. There’s no cure,” said Eldredge.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What a fascinating location your city has, Mr.
Waite!” said Cantor. “I call to mind no other great
city situated directly upon an international boundary-line.
You sit in your offices and look into foreign
territory—but I presume you are so accustomed
to it that you seldom give it a thought.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Somehow,” said Potter, “we don’t think of
Canada as foreign.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” said Cantor, “but I can conceive of circumstances
which would compel you to think of it
as foreign. I understand your government is irritated
by certain British actions with regard to your
mails and shipping. Might not something disagreeable
grow out of that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It might. These are puzzling days, Mr. Cantor.
I confess I am bewildered by them. Impossible
events happen with startling ease, and inevitable
consequences fail to follow amazingly. Yes, I can
imagine trouble coming with Great Britain, but somehow
it does seem unlikely as long as Germany lays
a murder on every mail-bag England plays. You
aren’t especially apt to bother with a man who jostles
you in a crowd if there is another man trying to hit
you with an ax.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Cantor half shut his eyes and peered into his glass.
Presently he looked up to Potter and nodded. “I get
your point of view,” he said. “I wonder how many
people share it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve given up guessing what the people think.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It wouldn’t surprise me to see your public opinion
veering to favor Germany.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Some of our public opinion does favor it. Our
German-Americans and such like.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A good many of them—millions I understand.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perhaps capable of influencing a majority?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know,” said Potter, and nodded his head,
not exactly with satisfaction, but as a man does
who fancies he has made a point in an argument.
“German public opinion here seems to be organized,”
said Potter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The German government is efficient. If it has
felt the need of fostering your favorable opinion, I
think we may say it has taken steps to foster it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter wondered just where Cantor stood in the
matter, but the courteous air of the man, his manner
of putting a question, were not those of a man holding
to one opinion or the other, but of a seeker after
information. He asked questions, but answered
none, not even by the expression of his face. He
had made no direct statement; had shown neither
pleasure nor displeasure with what he had heard.
Yet Potter judged him to be a man capable of strong
opinions and of taking action in support of them.
There was nothing neutral about the man. He was
positive, but baffling. He was an individual who
would play his cards on the merits of his own hand,
Potter thought, and would carry his betting just as
far as the value of his cards warranted. Until that
point arrived he would not lay down his hand. Potter
determined to see what a direct question would
produce.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you think of the sinking of the <em>Lusitania</em>?”
he asked, abruptly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Cantor regarded him for an instant with the air
of a man who wishes to use care to express himself
clearly, and then he replied with such a manner of
clarity as made Potter chuckle inwardly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The sinking of the <em>Lusitania</em>,” he said, with the
positiveness of a man stating an incontrovertible
fact, “is a matter without precedent. It is my firm
opinion that the German Admiralty considered carefully
every effect which might derive from it before
ordering the act.”</p>

<p class='c004'>An ironic rejoinder occurred to Potter—a rejoinder
which he would have made regardless of courtesy
had his unlovable mood been upon him—but he
withheld it now, contenting himself with a smile
which Cantor read correctly and answered with a
twinkle of his clear eyes. Potter knew that Cantor
had weighed his intention to draw a positive statement
and rather enjoyed the knowledge that Potter
understood fully his evasion of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>The conversation turned to less momentous affairs,
but it seemed as if Cantor could not express fully
his admiration for Detroit and for its location. He
spoke of the Lakes, of the millions of tons of ore and
millions of bushels of wheat traveling past Detroit’s
door in the holds of mighty vessels; of vessels which
carried northward cargoes of coal to a region where
coal was a necessity. He referred to the carriage of
passengers by water on steamers of a size and luxury
which the stranger perceived with amazement on an
inland waterway. He had a word to say about the
ship-canals at Sault Sainte Marie and the Welland,
and of that minor canal at the mouth of the River
St. Clair. Eldredge told him something of the new
channel constructed in American waters across Lime
Kiln Crossing and Bar Point Shoals below the city,
and described how engineers had constructed the
mightiest coffer dam in the history of engineering;
how they had built dikes miles in length to hold out
the waters of the river, pumped dry the areas between,
and then sawed their channel out of the dry
rock. Cantor was fascinated by it all.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But,” said he, “those are points of danger, are
they not? Suppose that war with England should
arrive. Would not your Eastern steel-mills, upon
which you must depend for the manufacture of ordnance
and munitions, be left helpless if one of these
gateways from lake to lake should be closed? Imagine
the destruction of the locks at the Soo, for instance?
Are they well guarded?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Probably,” said Potter, “there is an aged constable
with a tin star within calling distance.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is a splendid thing for a country to have the
feeling of security that yours holds,” said Cantor,
with open admiration that Potter felt, but could not
identify, to be derisive.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why should we guard them?” Eldredge asked.
“We aren’t fighting anybody. Besides, an army
never could get to them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter shot a glance at Eldredge which was tipped
with contempt, and Cantor intercepted it and smiled
at Potter as one man smiles who shares a bit of
humor with another. It was as much as to say,
“You and I have more common sense than to say
that, haven’t we?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Cantor drew the conversation away from war again.
“You play golf here frequently?” he asked Potter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“As often as I can manage it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I play a duffer’s game myself, but I hope you will
take me on some day. They tell me you are above
the average. I shall enjoy watching you—and possibly
can pick up some pointers. My approach is
miserable—miserable.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Easiest stroke in the bag,” said Eldredge.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No doubt, but there is no easiest stroke for me.
In my case they are all difficult, with some worse
than the rest.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Glad to go around with you any time,” said Potter,
and Cantor made it apparent that he was really
gratified. He had abilities that way, a manner which
seemed, without effusiveness, to express admiration;
to show that he was most favorably impressed by a
companion.</p>

<p class='c004'>Either the man was naturally affable or he had
set himself with purpose to make friends of those
in whose company he found himself at that moment,
Potter decided. As for Potter, he did not enter into
the conversation, but sat back listening and thinking.
Without setting himself deliberately to do so, he
studied Mr. Cantor, and was compelled to the conclusion
that the stranger was an exceptionally brilliant
man; not only that, but a man of personality,
dominating personality. The others of the party
appeared colorless when set against him. Potter
wondered if he himself seemed as colorless as they.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter was one who liked or disliked swiftly.
Usually, on meeting an individual, he determined
instantly and almost automatically whether or not
he cared to continue the acquaintance and to admit
the stranger to fellowship. He found himself unable
to make up his mind about Cantor. That gentleman
was too complex to make the judgment of him a
matter of a word and a glance.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter was disturbed and uneasy. The atmosphere
of the club piazza irritated him this afternoon. He
could not enter into the spirit of the effort to make
dragging time pass endurably, which was the profession
of most of the men present. Major Craig had
surprised him, had increased the restlessness, the
dissatisfaction which so frequently possessed him,
and he wanted to go away alone to carry out the
major’s direction to think. He got up suddenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m off,” he said. “Hope I shall see more of
you, Mr. Cantor.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I should like to call as soon as convenient,” said
Cantor, “to present my letters.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We don’t go much on letters of introduction out
here,” Potter said, smiling. “A letter of introduction
never made anybody like a man he didn’t cotton
to, nor dislike a man he took a liking to. Call
when you like, and don’t bother with the letters.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Cantor laughed. “Perhaps you’re right. But I’ve
always believed that a man coming to a strange place
should come well introduced, if he can. People are
suspicious of strangers. I have provided myself with
letters because it is important to me that there
should be no uncertainties about me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Bring them along, then,” said Potter, who was
by nature unfitted to understand how anybody could
care much what strangers or acquaintances thought
of him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter walked to his car, and in a moment was
driving toward the street. A runabout which he
recognized at once turned into the grounds and a
glance showed him Hildegarde von Essen was driving.
She saw him at the same instant, and lifted her
hand, drawing over to the side of the drive and
stopping. He drew up beside her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“To-morrow’s Tuesday,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now look here, Miss von Essen, your father—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“My father’s aunt’s rheumatism!” she said.
“Father’s in New York, and you promised.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know I promised, but in the circumstances you
ought to let me off. He didn’t exactly welcome me
with open arms, and the Lord only knows what he’d
do if I took you flying.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You promised,” she repeated, stubbornly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know,” he said, with the elaborate pretense of
patience one shows to a difficult child, “but—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And I’m not afraid of father. To-morrow morning?
I’ll be ready as early as you like.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nine-thirty, then,” he said, helplessly, “at the
hangar.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She beamed on him. “You’re a duck, Mr. Waite,”
she said, “and I’ll not let father hurt you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She drove on and left him looking after her. What
a flamelike little thing she was, he thought. What
he did not think was—how like she was to himself;
how her restlessness matched his; how her recklessness
and his recklessness were cut off the same
piece. And she was charming in an exciting sort
of way. “If she ever cuts loose—” he said to
himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>He drove home and went up to his own rooms to
sit down with his pipe and figure matters out. Almost
word for word he could repeat what the major
had said to him, and he looked for answers to the
major’s questions. Did he love his country? What
would he do if war came? What ought he to do?...
The first was hardest to answer. He had not been
accustomed to the idea of love of country, but had
been contented with the thought that America was
a good-enough place and he was generally satisfied
with it. He tried picturing to himself the invasion of
Michigan by German troops; the re-enacting of the
crime of Louvain upon the city of Detroit. His
imagination was vivid, active.... As he created
the picture he felt emotion welling up within him, a
sense of the unbearableness of what he had imagined,
the feeling that he could not endure the happening of
such a catastrophe. It was not reason, but heart,
that told him there was nothing he would not sacrifice,
suffer, endure to prevent it—and then he asked
himself why.... It seemed, then, that he did love
his country. In that event—what?</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Hildegarde von Essen sprang boyishly
out of her roadster at the door to Potter
Waite’s hangar. She looked like a glorious, slender
boy in the riding-breeches and puttees she had
thought appropriate for the adventure—not like an
ordinary boy, but rather like some princeling out of
a fairy-tale. There was that air about her—the air
of a prince who trafficked with fairies and would ride
forth to battle with giants and dragons. Her eyes
danced with excitement and anticipation; she was
charged with eager life until it seemed to radiate
from her and to form a tingling aura about her.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter appeared in the doorway and stopped
abruptly as his eyes found her. It was the sincerest
tribute. He felt as if some potent current had darted
out from her to touch him with its mysterious force—almost
as if it arrested his heart an instant and
made it skip a beat.... That was the way she
looked; not dazzlingly beautiful; the effect was not
that of beauty, but of something more compelling,
more thrilling. It was rather as if Youth in person
advanced to meet him—throbbing, eager, glowing
Youth; neither masculine nor feminine, but the personification
of everything young, ardent, breathless,
fearless.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m early,” she said, “but I <em>had</em> to come. I
hardly slept all night for thinking about it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He advanced, finding that he very much wanted
to take her hand, and she looked up into his face and
laughed impishly, for it was plain reading to her that
she had startled this young man and unsettled his
equilibrium.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come in,” he said, rather stupidly. “We’ve
been tinkering, but we’re nearly ready now, I guess.”
He knew it was hardly the thing to say to such a
magical creature, but it was the best he could do.</p>

<p class='c004'>She walked to the machine and patted the tip of
its wing. “We’re going to be friends, aren’t we?”
she said to it, and smiled up at Potter again. “How
do I get in? Where do I sit?” Her voice was
eager.</p>

<p class='c004'>It had been in his mind before she came to try to
persuade her against the flight; to show her the inadvisability
of it, especially in the face of her father’s
attitude toward him. He did not make the effort
now. It seemed futile, not to be considered, so he
helped her to her place silently. “Ready?” he asked
one of the men in overalls who were going fussily
about the ’plane, touching wires, testing braces.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ready, sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter looked at Hildegarde. No trace of fear or
nervousness was visible, nor was she calm. Her
eyes danced with excitement, her face was alight with
gay eagerness. “I don’t suppose I could drive it,
could I?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, <em>hardly</em>,” Potter said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’d love to. I’m sure I could.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“This is your excursion,” he said, disregarding her
manifest desire to become pilot of the craft. “What
part of the earth shall we fly over?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s to be a good, long fly, you know,” she said.
“Not just up and down like those twenty-five-dollars-a-ride
things we had here last year. I want to
go miles and miles.... Let’s go right across the
lake to the Flats and then swing around and come
home over Mount Clemens. Can we do that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have made that circle.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do I do?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sit still and hang on. There’s no promenade-deck
to this ship—no orchestra and no dancing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you a dancing-man?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Far from it. The <em>thé dansant</em> is too dangerous for
me. I don’t speak the language.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I <em>love</em> to dance,” she said. “I don’t know that
the language is more difficult than the one you speak
while we dance on the floor above. ‘Waiter, another
round of cocktails.’”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter climbed up and settled himself in his seat.
“You’re not going to quarrel because I don’t like
dancing?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’d forgive you ’most anything this morning.
Let’s start. I’m crazy to know how it feels.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The engine started with a tremendous throbbing
roar and the hydro-aeroplane was trundled out on
its rails and down the incline to the smooth waters
of Lake St. Clair. For an interval it scudded along,
neither floating nor flying, like a wild duck frightened
and beginning its flight; then the water dropped
away, and they were mounting, mounting into the
clear, cold spring air.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter directed their flight out over the lake, presently
veering to the northward and heading toward
a small black blot resting distantly on the glittering
expanse of water. Hildegarde’s cheeks were flushed,
her eyes excited, brilliant. She sat drinking in the
sensation of flight, and watching with childish joy
and wonder as the lake spread its beautiful panorama
beneath and on all sides of them. It seemed
but a moment before the distant blot became the
familiar light-ship, and, looking ahead, she could see
dimly the parallel lines which she knew must be
the ship-canal which opened a passage for the largest
freighter through the bars and shoals into that
channel of the delta of the St. Clair River which has
for a generation been a marvelous playground for
the Lake region, a playground rising on a ribbon of
spiling—a sort of hem binding the raveling edge of
the great marsh.</p>

<p class='c004'>Slow as the ’plane was, compared with those miracles
of speed with which the chivalry of the air hold
their tournaments in the lists of the sky, it seemed
to eliminate time and space. Distances which the
swiftest vessel passed laboriously in an hour seemed
to withdraw themselves as at a magic word of command.
Abreast of the light-ship they passed an
up-bound freighter. Its deck seemed a mammoth
gridiron as Hildegarde looked down upon it—a gridiron
whose cross-bars were battened hatches. It was
traveling its fifteen miles an hour on its way to
Duluth or Superior—but they left it behind. It
dropped away from them almost with the swiftness
of a falling stone.</p>

<p class='c004'>They flew low over the piers, and then mounted.
Beneath them lay the familiar, rambling structures
of the Old Club. They continued to mount, for
Potter wanted to spread before her the great reaches
of the delta—a world of close-growing wild rice and
reeds, a universe of wild birds, myriad tiny islets,
with here and there a strip of land high enough above
the water to supply a foothold for wind-bent, scraggling
trees. Here and there wound a maze of channels,
some navigable by small boats, and to the
northward another gleaming river, the North Channel,
up which the fleets of the Lakes had been compelled
to pass before the construction of the ship-canal.</p>

<p class='c004'>Before them stretched the interminable line of
summer cottages and hotels, untenanted now. To
the right and left of it were loneliness, desolation—yet
a certain arresting beauty. Hildegarde felt a sudden
loneliness.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter veered to the left over huge Muscamoot
Bay, a bay whose waters were hidden by reeds and
rice—a hundred square miles of reeds and rice and
shallows. One could wade almost the length and
breadth of it. Hildegarde picked out a tiny island
in the midst of the waste, and the thought came to
her that here one could hide in security if all the
world joined in the hunt.</p>

<p class='c004'>She became aware that the motor no longer roared
in perfect rhythm. It seemed to pant and labor, to
snort in disgust. It was missing, and she saw that
Potter was intent upon it. Suddenly silence fell.
Hildegarde had not known that silence could be like
this. It was as if the end of all sound in the universe
had come, as if life had been extinguished, and they
two, soaring in the sky, were alone left of all the teeming
millions of the earth’s population....</p>

<p class='c004'>She was not frightened, but looked at Potter’s
face for its expression. It was one of irritation, not
of alarm.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll have to ’plane down while I tinker,” he
said. “This is a <em>fine</em> day for something to go wrong.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’ll be fun,” she exclaimed. “Imagine being cast
away down there—in an aeroplane!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It won’t be such a picnic if I can’t get her going
again. Hotels and mechanicians and telephone service
are moderately scarce below.”</p>

<p class='c004'>All the while they were sliding down an invisible
hill, swiftly, smoothly. A narrow ribbon of open
water lay below them, and Hildegarde imagined
Potter to be heading for it as a place of landing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why,” she exclaimed, “there’s a house!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter did not turn his head; he was busy now
with the ’plane.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There are a few scattered in the bay—squatters
and summer folks. Muskrat trappers and French
fishermen.... Mighty lonesome, <em>I’d</em> say.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A puff of wind caused the ’plane to swerve and
rock. Hildegarde saw Potter suddenly in feverish
action. They were swerving away from the ribbon of
water, which was now close below, veering toward
the island upon which she had been astonished to
see a house.... The ’plane would not obey. It
swept on and down.... Almost in a winking of the
eye the solid land was before them ... a tree....
Hildegarde felt a wrench, a shock, heard a
crash, and saw the planes at their right side crumple
and shatter as they were sheared off in collision with
the willow-tree.... The crippled ’plane careened
sickeningly—and there was a frightful shock....</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter, half blind, dizzy, suffering agonies, crept
out of the wreckage. One leg dragged helplessly.
There was a wrenching pain inside. Dumbly he
looked for Hildegarde. She lay at a little distance—without
movement. She was stretched at full
length, her face pillowed on her arm as if she
had lain down on the grass for a nap. Peacefully,
gracefully she lay—but very still. Potter dragged
himself toward her, reached her. Then he was conscious
that a man was running to them, was stooping
over them. He looked up into the man’s face.
It was very confusing. He seemed to know the
man, yet it was impossible the man should be
there....</p>

<p class='c004'>“How do you do, Cantor?” he said. “Did you—bring—your
letters?...”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then his arms failed him and he slumped downward,
his face resting on Hildegarde’s knees.</p>

<p class='c004'>The man Potter had called Cantor turned the
young man over gently, wiped the blood from his
face with his handkerchief, and grunted. He opened
Potter’s clothing and laid an ear to his breast. The
heart was beating feebly.... Hasty examination
showed him Hildegarde was alive, too.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Start the boat,” he called over his shoulder.
“Be quick about it.” He lifted Hildegarde and carried
her past the house to a tiny dock and handed
her aboard a narrow, cabined motor-boat. “Two of
you get the man,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What will we do with them?” a man asked, in
German.</p>

<p class='c004'>“To the hospital in that town—Mount Clemens,”
the man in authority replied, in the same language.
“They’re badly hurt. I doubt if he lives to get
there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So much the better,” growled the man. “Do
you go with us?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I remain.... You found them on the shore ten
miles from here. Don’t be definite. To-night we’ll
get the wreck of this machine across and out of the
way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What was he doing here, Herr?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing for you to worry about.... The
chances are he’ll never regain consciousness. If
he does he won’t be able to remember anything....
Make haste, for he’s more valuable alive than
dead.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The motor-boat swung into the channel and sped
away. Once in open water, it showed an astonishing
gift of speed as it made for the mouth of the Clinton
River.</p>

<p class='c004'>Not as they wound their way up the narrow river,
not as they touched the wharf, did Potter or Hildegarde
betray a sign of returning consciousness. The
man in charge leaped ashore. He had chosen his
landing with judgment, for the spot was deserted.
For ten minutes he disappeared, returning with two
men from a near-by office.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We found them on the shore ten miles up,” said
the man who habitually spoke in German, but whose
English was acceptable. “They fell with an aeroplane.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who are they?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The man shook his head. “I don’t know anything....
We found them, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Presently the authorities who had been telephoned
for arrived, and Potter and Hildegarde were lifted
gently and carried away. In the haste and excitement
the men who had brought them to the spot
were not questioned, as they might have been in a
city more accustomed to the handling of accidents.
As the two inert bodies were carried away the motor-boat
quietly moved away from the dock and headed
down the river. No one thought to hold it. Presently
it disappeared....</p>

<p class='c004'>At the hospital Potter was quickly identified by
the contents of his pockets. There was no clue to
Hildegarde’s identity. The news of the accident to
his son was telephoned to Fabius Waite, and local
correspondents of Detroit papers saw that the story
went where it should go. In two hours city reporters
were on hand, for the thing promised to be that desirable
thing known to newspaper men as a “big
story.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The early editions carried brief accounts of the
accident to Potter Waite and an unknown young
woman.... Identification came later, and in the
morning papers the names of Potter Waite and Hildegarde
von Essen were coupled in a manner not likely
to give satisfaction to the girl’s father.</p>

<p class='c004'>Reporters set out to find the smashed aeroplane,
but their search was futile. It was not found until
noon next day, when a farmer on the shores of Baltimore
Bay telephoned that it lay against a tree on
his farm, near the shore. Reporters viewed it, and
from its position were able to describe accurately
how the thing had happened. “Must have been
pickled again,” was the consensus of their experienced
opinion, and they did not hesitate in their
accounts to impart this view to their public. Also
the morning papers reported that Potter would not
live through the day. Hildegarde was still unconscious,
but hopes for her recovery were entertained
by the surgeons in charge.</p>

<p class='c004'>Altogether it was looked upon as the inevitable—and
fitting—termination of the reckless career of a
vicious and depraved youth. It was an affair to be
reveled in by the sensational press. They made an
orgy of it.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>“Any news of Potter Waite to-day?” Tom Watts
asked, as he dropped into a chair at the
table which was regarded as the property of the
crowd in the Pontchartrain bar.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No change,” La Mothe said. “Still unconscious
or something like that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Anybody seen him? Any of the crowd been out
to Mount Clemens?” asked Brick O’Mera.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No good. They wouldn’t let anybody in. They
say he just lies with his eyes half open. When you
say he’s alive that ends it. It’s a matter of days,
they say.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Seems like we ought to do something—this
crowd he trained with,” said O’Mera.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll get together and send him some bang-up
flowers,” said Randall. “One of those pillow things,
or a horseshoe or something. Most likely they’ll
want us for pall-bearers.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I sent him a box of cigars and a book,” said
Kraemer, seriously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Which, being unconscious, he’s enjoyed like the
devil,” said La Mothe. “There’s the Teutonic mind
for you, fellows. Gets an idea and goes ahead with
it regardless.... I suppose if Potter had been an
Englishman you’d have sent him cigars with
dynamite in ’em.” La Mothe took great joy in baiting
Kraemer, for whom, nevertheless, he had a very
considerable affection.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You always send cigars and books to a sick
man,” Kraemer said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And torpedo vessels—even when there are
women and babies on ’em. Women and babies ought
to keep off vessels, is that your idea?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course.... Listen here, you fellows.” His
voice changed to the voice of one repeating a lesson
learned by heart. Even the wording was not his
own. “Germany acted within her rights in sinking
the <em>Lusitania</em>, because she gave preliminary notice
to all the world by establishing a war zone around
England. She gave special notice to travelers before
the sailing of the <em>Lusitania</em>. England is to blame for
what happened because she used American citizens
as human shields to guard ammunition supplies on
an English auxiliary cruiser.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hear! Hear!” applauded La Mothe. “Doesn’t
he recite beautifully! Who taught you the piece,
Wilhelm?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hear the von Essen girl is coming out all right,”
said Watts.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Her father said so at the Harmonie last night,”
Kraemer told them. “She’ll be out of the hospital
in a couple of weeks. Nothing broken, just shock,
and a little concussion.... If Potter doesn’t die
von Essen will kill him. He talked like a crazy man.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wonder how she got mixed up with Potter?”
Watts said. “She’s only a kid, isn’t she?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The speediest kid this town’s seen for a while.
Regular little devil. Always up to something. They
say she had old von Essen fighting for air most of the
time.” La Mothe usually could be trusted to supply
the spice. “Natural enough she and Potter should
fly in a flock. Same kind of birds.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The rate Potter was traveling, he was bound to
come a cropper some day,” said Randall, virtuously.</p>

<p class='c004'>They were already speaking of him in the past
tense; Potter Waite, in a couple of weeks, had
become something that used to exist.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You could trust him to make it a gilt-edged,
sensational cropper when he got to it,” La Mothe
rejoined. “He was one good scout.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But peculiar. He was all-fired peculiar,” Kraemer
said, seriously. “I never quite understood him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, the data’s all in, Wilhelm; there’ll never
be any more. Study over it a few years and you
may begin to get him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ve got to hand it to Potter for one thing,”
said Watts; “if he made up his mind to do a thing he
would pull it off, hell or high water.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a moment’s silence, a moment’s depression,
then La Mothe said, “Seen the new girl that’s
dancing at the Tuller?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Interest quickened. One might almost say that
the agile, silken-clad legs of the dancer kicked Potter
Waite out of the minds of his friends. Why not?
They had pronounced his obituary. He had been
and was not. Dancers must dance and cocktails must
be mixed and the world must wag on as is its custom,
though more important personages than a reckless,
headstrong, purposeless boy be removed from
the scene.</p>

<p class='c004'>Two weeks and three days passed over Potter’s
unconscious head. He did not know that his mother
sat by his bedside through long days and slept in an
adjoining room through sleepless, woeful nights. He
did not know how much of the priceless time of his
busy father was spent in that still room. Had he
been conscious he might have understood something
of his mother’s agony, for, quiet, simple as she was,
she had retained her turbulent son’s affection. Perhaps
she understood him. Assuredly she had never
abandoned hope for him even when his wildest
escapade was bruising her heart. But she had not
been strong enough, forceful enough, to restrain
him, and, realizing her limitation, she had grieved
silently.</p>

<p class='c004'>In his most alert moment Potter could not have
read Fabius Waite’s mind. A tidal wave of business
success had carried Fabius far away from his son,
into a distant country. For a dozen years they had
been growing farther and farther apart, each taking
the other for granted, looking upon the other as
something that was and could not be blinked.
Fabius had no time for his son; Potter had no time
for his father. They had no point of contact....
It was natural that Potter should now be unable to
see into his father’s heart and comprehend the love
that had sprung to life again, the dull ache of self-accusation
that would not be assuaged. He could
not know that Fabius Waite was saying in his secret
soul, “This is my son, my only son, and I have
sinned against him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mother,” said Fabius, that afternoon, and his
voice was different from the voice with which he
usually spoke, “this is my fault.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She did not seek to comfort him by a denial. “We
have both been to blame,” she said, gently.</p>

<p class='c004'>Fabius was silent a moment; then he said, fiercely,
“I’ve been a hell of a father....”</p>

<p class='c004'>She laid her hand on his knee and he placed his
hand over it. Many years had passed since they had
sat with hand touching hand.... The nurse sat
looking from the window, her back to the bed. Suddenly
a voice, yet not a voice so much as the ghost
of a voice, spoke from the pillow. It was not a
babble, not a mutter. It was a whisper directed by
a mind. “Hello—folks!” it said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Father and mother were on their feet, bending
over the bed. Their son had spoken; his eyes looked
up at them, dim, but intelligently; their son whom
famous surgeons had told them would never regain
consciousness!</p>

<p class='c004'>“He knows us! He knows us!” his mother whispered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sure,” Potter said. “What ...”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then he was gone again into that murky region
which was not life and which was not death.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nurse!” said Fabius Waite, tensely, “he spoke.
He recognized us.... What—what does that
mean?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The nurse knew no more than they. It might be
a promise held out to them; it might have been his
farewell to the world. She could not tell.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He knew us,” Fabius said to himself again and
again. “He knew us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>So the boy who could not live lived on. Intervals
of consciousness came again and again, and lasted
longer and longer. The physicians, who would not
admit of hopes at first, were compelled—against their
wills, it seemed—to give Potter a reluctant chance
of recovery.... Another ten days saw him fully
conscious—not safe yet, but with chances of safety
multiplied. Though doubts existed in the medical
mind, none were permitted to exist in the minds of
Fabius Waite and his wife. Their son was to be
given back to them; they <em>knew</em> it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Despite fractured bones, despite invisible but awful
injuries, Potter not only clung to the life that was
in him, but reached out and strengthened his grasp
upon it, until even the medical mind was convinced
and, with due eye to its reputation, gave to the parents
the assurance, “We’ve saved him,” and then
expatiated on the miracle wrought by its skill. Two
months after the catastrophe Potter Waite was on
his snail-like way to recovery.</p>

<p class='c004'>At first Potter seemed to have little curiosity
regarding his accident. He appeared not to remember
it or to have any idea why he was in his bed in
a hospital. Later he asked questions.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Somebody was with me,” he said one day.
“When we fell ...”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hildegarde von Essen,” his mother said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Was she—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“As well as ever,” his mother said, a bit resentfully.
“She has been out of the hospital for
weeks.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s ... good,” said Potter.</p>

<p class='c004'>A day or two later he asked about his ’plane.
“What’s become of it?” he wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s up on the shore where you—fell,” his
mother said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The shore?” he repeated. “The shore?...
What shore?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“About ten miles up on Baltimore Bay,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>He thought about that for minutes, and it was
apparent he was not satisfied. “It was on an island,”
he said. “A little island ... not on Baltimore
Bay.... Just back of the Flats.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, son, it was on the mainland. You—you
don’t remember.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He shook his head uneasily, and his eyes were
puzzled. “There was an island,” he said, and then
let the subject drop as if he were too weary to go on
with it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is the war still going on?” he asked, one day.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are we in it?” he asked, after a pause.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We should—be,” he said. “There’s some reason
why we should, but I seem to—have forgotten it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Day by day he grew stronger; day by day his
memory returned to him, and he brooded over his
recollections. For hours he would lie with closed
eyes—thinking. It was the first quiet he had ever
known; the first opportunity ever forced upon him
to think. He remembered Major Craig.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Would you like to read to me?” he asked, one
day.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’d love to, son. What shall I read?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wish you’d get a history of the United States—the
best one there is. I’d like you to read that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>So his mother sat by his bedside and read to him
the history of his country, and when she laid down
the book he considered what she had read, and
pondered over the significance of it. He had been
vaguely familiar with the history of the nation, but
only vaguely. Now he was meeting his country for
the first time, and groping for an understanding of
it. Major Craig had asked him if he loved his country....
He fancied he had answered that question
when he imagined it invaded as Belgium had been
invaded. Now, day by day, he was learning why
he should love his country; what his country meant,
why it existed, why it had prospered, what his country
was giving to him as one of its citizens. The
United States was emerging from chaos in his mind,
assuming a distinct entity, a <em>character</em>.... It was
a lovable character. As he lay there, listening to
the story of its life, Potter Waite was falling in love—he
was falling in love with his country and his country’s
flag.</p>

<p class='c004'>His mother understood something of what was
passing in his mind. It made her glad, for there
was promise in it.... One day, following the completion
of the history, she brought a thin little book.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’d like to read this to you, son,” she said, and
he, not even asking for its name, because he thought
to please her, nodded assent. It was a story with a
peculiar title. “<em>The Man Without a Country</em>,” his
mother said.</p>

<p class='c004'>She commenced to read, and he lay with eyes
closed, his attention not fixed. Presently he opened
his eyes, and before half a dozen pages were read he
was giving to the reading such attention as he had
never given to any narrative before. His eyes did
not leave his mother’s face, and there came into them
a hungry, troubled look.... His mother’s face
became dim, and he realized that he was seeing through
a mist. Every word of that wonderful lesson, that
text-book of patriotism, was reaching his mind as
with rays of white light. At last she finished and
looked down at him, and his cheeks were wet. She
did not speak. It was he who spoke after a long
silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s the answer,” he said, and his mother,
possessing that marvelous quality, intuition, went
quietly out of the room.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was not long before he was able to sit up. Two
weeks past the second month of his confinement, he
was well enough to be taken to his home, and there,
in his own rooms, he demanded books. Not the books
one might suppose, not books to pass the long hours
of convalescence lightly, but treatises on the gas-engine,
on carburetion, on ignition; highly specialized
books on the aeroplane.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I should think you’d had aeroplane enough,”
his father said—a father who was now nearer to him
by much than he had been before. “You’re not going
to meddle with those things again, I hope.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dad,” said Potter, slowly, “they’re the only thing
I’m going to meddle with. They’re my business, and
I haven’t any other business.... I’m going to be
the man in the United States who knows more
about aeroplanes and how to build them than anybody
else.... And some day I’m going to build
them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can’t make it a commercial success, son. Nothing
in it. If you want to get into business seriously,
why, when you’re strong enough, just drop around
at the plant. I’ll give you all the business you want.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m not thinking about commercial success,”
said Potter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the big idea, then?” his father asked,
jocularly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you believe we can keep out of this war?”
Potter countered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Certainly. Why not? All we’ve got to do is
keep our heads level and mind our own business.
Nobody can get to us, and we couldn’t get to anybody.
You can’t go to war in this country unless
the people want war—and you never saw a people
who want war less.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They’re educated not to want war,” Potter said,
with an access of shrewdness. “Business is educating
them, and I shouldn’t be surprised if Germany
was helping the education along. The Germans
seem to be pretty well organized in a publicity way
over here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, don’t let the possibility of war bother you.
It won’t come.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m afraid, Dad,” Potter said, “that it <em>will</em>
come. If it comes, what shape are we in to fight?
Do you realize that we would have to have twenty
thousand aeroplanes? That’s one item, but one of
the most important. Twenty thousand! An army
of millions—and the aeroplane is as vital to the
army as the commissariat. That’s fact. You can’t
dodge it. And we’ve got to get ready. Not to build
an army of men alone. That is simple compared to
the other things.... Where would we get twenty
thousand aeroplanes if they were necessary suddenly?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We wouldn’t,” said Fabius, and he laughed
indulgently. “When you’re well, you’ll get these notions
out of your head. It’s just your condition,
son. It’ll work off.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, Dad. It’s here to stay.... We’ve got
about fifty ’planes to-day. Bulgaria’s got more....
Do you care much if this country keeps on?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, sure! I’m an American. It’s my country,
but I guess nobody’s going to monkey with us.” It
was the old, absurd notion of military invincibility.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’re going to get a mighty unpleasant waking
up.... We’ve got to get ready. If we’re ready
there’s less likelihood of trouble than if we aren’t.
Burglars don’t break into a house when a policeman
is standing in front and a bulldog is barking inside....
It’s insurance. But we won’t get ready. Not
all of us.” He paused, and something in the level
determination that shone from Potter’s eyes impressed
his father.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But one of us will be ready,” Potter said, “and
that’s me. I’m going to be ready for the day when
the country needs that twenty thousand ’planes.
I’m going to know how to build them, and I’m going
to know where and how they can be built. Dad,
the day’s coming when the main business of the Waite
Motor Car Company will be the building of aeroplane
engines.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fiddlesticks!” said Fabius Waite, and there
could be no doubt of his sincerity. Fabius Waite
considered himself a good American. He was a good
American, but, like millions of other able, sincere,
honest, country-loving men in those summer days
of the year 1915; those days which were seeing
Italy’s entrance to the war, which were witnessing
Mackensen’s war-machine crushing the Russians out
of Galicia, capturing Przemysl and then Lemberg;
wondering if Calais and the Channel ports could be
held;—like those other millions Fabius Waite was
asleep. Potter’s voice was of one crying in the wilderness.
All ears were shut against him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>If every young man could be put in a position where
he could do nothing but think for a matter of a
couple of months just at that time when he is ready
to take up the major business of his life, one may well
believe the history of the world would be other and
better than it is. Potter Waite was injured early
in May. Three months passed before he was able
to take the air even in a slowly driven, pillowed
limousine. If ever a chance were given a human
being to check up on his accounts, take a trial balance,
and arrive at definite conclusions with respect
to himself, Potter had that chance. Not only had
he the opportunity, but a vital consideration had
intervened, urging him to wider, deeper, bolder considerations.
He thought much about Potter Waite,
but the time in which he lived, the world turmoil
which surrounded him, the pressure of great events
on his own life, compelled him to think about himself
with respect to grave, impending affairs and to
the requirements of his country, which he had come,
in some measure, to know.</p>

<p class='c004'>This state of affairs developed in him a rare singleness
of purpose. From the beginning of time men
with rare singleness of purpose have been regarded
as monomaniacs, cranks. They have been derided.
The world has whispered about them behind its
hands and snickered. This was an attitude which
Potter was to encounter, first from his father, later
from those who had formerly been his cronies.</p>

<p class='c004'>Fabius Waite became more and more irritated by
his son’s absorption in aeronautics, for he was a
practical business man, and when he could not see
how a profit could be entered in the ledger from a
given transaction, he deleted the transaction.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m glad, of course,” he said to Potter, “to see
you taking an interest in something—outside the
Pontchartrain bar and the chorus of a comic opera—but
you’re going over the line with this thing. You’re
getting as bad as Old Man Jeffords. I sit in directors’
meeting at the bank with him once a week,
and he’ll butt into any sort of a discussion with
idiocy about some new postage stamp he’s found in
somebody’s attic. I suppose people must have fads
and amusements.” He said it as if he did not in the
least see why they should have such absurd things.
“But they can be carried too far. You’re riding
this hobby day and night. Aeroplanes! There’s no
money in aeroplanes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m not thinking of making money out of them,”
said Potter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then why are you monkeying with them? Too
much aeroplane, or too much golf, or too much
bridge, or too much anything that interferes with a
man’s business, is about as bad as too much whisky.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But aeroplanes are my business.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fiddlesticks, son! You’ve been sick a long time,
and you’ve gotten this notion. Automobiles is your
business.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I guess we don’t get the same point of view,
Dad. You’re interested in one thing and I’m interested
in another. Somehow they don’t match up.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I should say they didn’t.... I think you and
I are better friends than we used to be, son.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” said Potter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“On the whole, your accident was a good thing
for both of us.... I’ve gotten acquainted with
you, son, and it’s done me good. You had me going
for a while. I thought you were a worthless young
cub who would never do anything but squander
what I made—and, by Jove! I was going to fix things
so you couldn’t! But you’re not. You’ve got the
stuff in you to take my place and carry on the business.
A few years’ training and you’ll be up to the
job. Don’t let any foolishness like this aeronautic
stuff side-track you. Why, you’ve got to be a regular
darn fanatic about it!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I suppose I have, Dad. I guess it needs a fanatic.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Fabius shook his head with disgust. “I don’t
want folks saying my son’s a crank,” he said. “I
suppose boys at your age are bound to have enthusiasms,
but there’s just one kind of enthusiasm that’s
worth a tinker’s dam, and that’s enthusiasm about
your business.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m sorry, Dad, if I disappoint you so much.
I expect to come into the business after a while—when
the world quiets down. I’ll work there as
hard as you want me to, but first I’ve got to do this
thing. It’s <em>got</em> to be done. Nobody knows what
will happen. You believe in fire insurance, don’t
you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Naturally.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But you go ahead planning as if there wouldn’t
be a fire. You don’t expect a fire.... But you
admit the possibility of it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, try to look at this thing in that way. We
don’t know what a year or two years may bring.
Germany may be licked or the Allies may be licked,
... or we may be dragged into it. That’s a fire
we’ve got to insure against. And I’m going into one
line of the insurance business—the aeroplane line.
If the fire comes we’ve got to have aeroplanes to
put it out. If it doesn’t come, no harm will be done
by insuring.... The difference is that I believe
it’s coming—and we won’t be ready.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All balderdash.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter got up and walked slowly across the room.
It was not easy, and his father was making it harder
than it ought to be. He thought he understood his
position and his reason for assuming it so clearly—that
they were so clear no one could fail to agree
with him, yet his father utterly failed to comprehend.
Potter despaired of making him understand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dad,” he said, “let’s make a bargain. Give
me two years. Call it a vacation or call it a course in
mechanics or call it whatever you want to. We
ought to know where we’re at by that time. At the
end of two years I’ll come into the business and
do whatever you want me to—but for two years let
me go ahead with this thing and don’t interfere with
me.... I’ll need some money, too. I’ve got to
experiment. The experimenting won’t do any harm.
It’ll be with gas-engines. Maybe I’ll turn out something
that will be worth money in our business....
just two years—and I’m pretty average young
yet.”</p>

<p class='c004'>His father shrugged his shoulders. “I’ll go you,”
he said, with the air of a man compelled against his
will. “Two years it is, and then you quit this foolishness
and come down to earth.... But it’s dog-gone
nonsense.”</p>

<p class='c004'>One man did not share this common opinion. He
was the bearded, ponderous, blinking man of monstrous
girth who had brought Potter into the world
and fed him pills and potions for his juvenile ailments—Old
Doctor Ormond.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Potter,” said the old gentleman, “you’ve been
down for three months. You’ve taken into your
system only the things you should have taken into
it. You have eaten as God and your stomach intended
a man should eat, and drunk as they intended
you should drink. You’re going to be well—as
well as ever. There won’t be a limp, probably.
I can guarantee that there isn’t a drop of alcohol
about you. You’re going to start clean. If you’ll
take my advice, which probably you won’t, you’ll
keep that way. Presbyterians used to say hell was
paved with unbaptized infants. <em>I</em> say it’s paved
with cocktail-shakers....”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter chuckled. “I’ve been thinking about the
cocktails,” he said. “I’m afraid I sha’n’t have time
for them. And I used to know bartenders by their
first names.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you ever feel a hankering?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter shook his head. “I never did when I had
anything else to do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Um!... Have you anything else to do now?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter held up the book on his lap. It was a
treatise on carburetion. “Aeroplanes,” he said,
shortly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your father said something about that,” said the
doctor. “What’s it all about?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“While I’ve been down and out,” Potter said,
slowly, “I’ve discovered that I’ve been a man without
a country. I’ve found my country. I’ve thought
<em>hard</em> and I believe my country is going to need me....
It can have me. If we get into this war, Doctor,
we’re going to need twenty thousand aeroplanes—quick.
I’ve a knack that way. By the time this
country needs the ’planes I’m going to know more
about building them than anybody else this side the
water—I’m going to be on the spot—ready....
That’s all there is to it. Dad thinks it’s a fad like
stamp-collecting, and that I’m a crank.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If it is,” said the fat old practitioner, blinking
his eyes, “I wish a hundred millions of us could get
bumped on the head and have a similar fad jarred
into us. You go to it, son. Stay by it. Don’t let
them whisper and ridicule you out of it. Do you
know that the greatest automobile manufacturer in
the world was once called Crazy Henry by his
friends? You don’t hear anybody calling him Crazy
Henry now, do you?... And remember this:
There’ll always be some to believe in you, and their
belief will be worth more to you than the ridicule
of all the rest. There’ll be a girl.... And there’ll
be a fat old man. Shake, son.” They shook hands
gravely. “Now get well—and show ’em.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The last thought the doctor left with Potter remained.
“There’ll always be some to believe in
you.... There’ll be a girl.” He wondered if there
would be a girl, and if she would believe in him.
Naturally there would be a girl sometime; there
never had been girls who ranked higher than episodes.
He had never seen a girl he wanted as a man
should want the girl who is to be his wife. Marriage
had been a dim event in the distant future. It was
so now. But, he thought, to have such a girl, to give
her such a love as he could imagine—<em>and to have her
believe in him</em>! That would be something. He pondered
it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Somehow he found himself thinking about Hildegarde
von Essen. It was a pleasant exercise. He recalled
her as he had seen her that morning when
she alighted from her machine at the door of his
hangar, radiant, vibrant, boyish—a flame of a girl.
That picture had persisted.</p>

<p class='c004'>They had visited the borderland of death together.
That event connected them, would always connect
them, by an invisible thread. He would not think
of her as he thought of other women, nor she of him.
Always the one would be to the other something
peculiarly distinct. There was an overpowering intimacy
about knocking hand in hand at the door of
death.</p>

<p class='c004'>He wondered how she was, wished he might see
her. He had not seen her since that moment when
he had crawled to her as she lay so still and graceful,
like a lovely boy asleep. That wakened other puzzling
memories. The scene was so distinct—the
little island, the reaches of the great marsh.... And
yet the island and marsh had not existed. They
had fallen on the mainland miles from any such
island! The ’plane had been found against a tree
miles away from it. There had been a man....
Potter was certain he remembered a man, and that
the man’s face had been familiar to him, but he could
not recall the man’s identity. The whole thing gave
him a queer, gasping sensation. It was like thinking
on eternity or on limitless space—something inconceivable.
He compelled himself to take his mind
away from it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hildegarde von Essen was away, had been sent
away by her enraged father as soon as she was able
to travel. First she had gone to an aunt in the
Adirondacks, was now with friends on the Maine
coast. Potter’s mother had told him this and had
told him, too, of the raging call Herman von Essen
had made on Fabius Waite, of the arrogant, brutal
manner of the man toward the father of a boy whose
death was declared inevitable. Fabius Waite had
shown von Essen the door almost with violence.</p>

<p class='c004'>Yes, Potter wanted to see her....</p>

<p class='c004'>That afternoon a servant brought him a letter. It
was from her, the first of her handwriting he had
ever seen.</p>

<p class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Potter</span>,” she began, addressing him by his
given name, and he did not regard it as forward or
provocative. It was merely due to the intimacy of
their adventure with death, and natural to him.
“I just found out you were able to read letters,” she
went on. “You can’t imagine the pains people are
at to keep news of you from me. It’s as if I’d tried
to elope with you and been caught. You knew
father shipped me away. You don’t know how glad
I was to know that you are going to be all right
again. Somehow I felt to blame.” How abruptly,
jerkily she wrote, changing from one subject to
another without warning. It was like her, he thought.
“I don’t know when I shall be home, but I’m making
myself as disagreeable as possible. I don’t think
they’ll be able to stand me much longer. Then I’ll
come to see you. It was great fun while it lasted.
I don’t think I ever enjoyed a morning as much.
There are things about it I don’t understand—where
we were found, for instance. <em>I</em> thought we fell on an
island. Didn’t you? I’ll write again when I can
steal time. It’s the least I can do, and we’re pals.
Aren’t we? Get well as quickly as you can and we’ll
fly again. Is the ’plane fixed?” That was all. It
stopped abruptly like that.</p>

<p class='c004'>She wanted to fly with him again. He chuckled.
A little thing like falling out of the sky would not
damp her enthusiasm, and fear seemed to have no
place in her vocabulary. She was the most utterly
daring girl he had ever met, and the most reckless of
consequences. He perceived her similarity to himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mr. La Mothe and Mr. Cantor to see you,”
announced a servant.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Send them up,” Potter directed, fumbling in his
memory for the name Cantor, recollecting it was the
chap he had met at the Country Club who had letters
of introduction to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>La Mothe and Cantor entered. Potter looked first
at Cantor. There was something about the man,
something that made his memory itch. He had seen
Cantor somewhere, but where? What was there
about the man? He noticed that Cantor scrutinized
him tensely. It was as if the man were searching
for something, something that he was afraid to
find.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Greetings, Potter,” said La Mothe. “You’re
looking bang-up for a fellow that was all fitted to a
coffin. We were taking up a subscription to send you
a floral pillow.... You remember Cantor?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” said Potter, extending his hand. “You’re
making quite a stay in Detroit.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’s joined the lodge,” La Mothe remarked.
“Shouldn’t be surprised if he squatted. Eh, Cantor?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I find Detroit very attractive, especially to a business
man,” said Cantor. “I’ve even thought of making
it my home.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s about the best compliment you could pay
the city,” said Potter, but in his mind he was saying
over and over: “What is it? What is there about
him? Where does he fit in?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve never had an opportunity to present some
letters I have from friends of yours, Mr. Waite. But
here they are.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“From Tom Herkimer and George Striker, eh?”
said Potter, glancing over the notes. “They seem
to be rather strong for you. I’m not very useful as an
acquaintance just now, but as soon as I’m on my
feet—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“As soon as you’re on your feet,” said La Mothe,
“he’ll have you chaperoning him through your plant.
He’s a regular factory hound. Never saw a man so
keen on factories.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m interested in mill-work and manufacturing
efficiency,” said Cantor. “It’s an important part of
my business.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’d say it was <em>all</em> of your business,” said La
Mothe, with a laugh. “I’ll bet he could draw from
memory the plans of half the plants in Detroit.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Cantor smiled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Speaking of plants,” said La Mothe, “things are
getting a little thick. I was just talking to Weston,
of the Structural Steel. He said they’d put armed
guards all around the plant. Found explosives in
the coal, and now they’re sorting over every chunk
of coal that comes in. They’re making shrapnel-cases,
you know.... Kraemer’s friend, the Kaiser,
is doing it, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dirty business,” Cantor said, easily. “Trouble
developed last week in the Delmont Machine Company’s
shops. They found somebody had put emery
in the bearings.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Any war news?” asked Potter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing big since Warsaw fell. Looks as if
Russia was about done,” La Mothe said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The war’s going into its second year,” said Cantor.
“Who thought it could last a year?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Looks as if we might have a little war of our own
one of these days. Mexico’s in need of a cleaning
up,” La Mothe said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s been Germany’s year,” Potter said. “Only
for the Marne—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It looks as if she couldn’t be beaten,” said Cantor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“She’s got to be beaten,” Potter replied. “The
sort of thing Germany stands for to-day has got to
be wiped out—wiped clean off the slate.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hang the war!” La Mothe said, impatiently.
“Can’t we talk about anything else? When does
the sawbones tell you you can come out and play
with the boys, Potter?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In a week or two now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll have to pull a party for you. Welcome
you back and all that. The crowd’ll be glad to see
you around.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m going to work,” Potter said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Whoop!” exclaimed La Mothe. “At what and
wherefore?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fred,” Potter said, “I want to talk things over
with you and some of the boys. I’m going to need
your help—all the fellows who are in the automobile
game. I’ve laid around for three months with nothing
to do but think, and I’m here to say that the old
stuff doesn’t go. We’ve got to take off our coats
and get to work.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“At what?” said La Mothe.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Aeroplanes,” said Potter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I thought you had about all the aeroplane that
was coming to you. Why aeroplanes?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The country’s going to need them, and Detroit’s
got to make the engines. You seemed to be surprised
that the war had lasted a year, Mr. Cantor. My
idea is that it’s just begun. It’ll spread, and it will
spread to us. We’ll be in it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Rats!” said La Mothe; but Potter was aware of
Cantor’s close scrutiny, and of an expression on the
older man’s face which baffled solution.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Germany has run wild with the notion of grabbing
the world,” Potter said. “If she gets away with
Europe we’ll come next.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fat chance. Germany doesn’t want any of our
action. Look how she backed down on the submarine
stuff.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ve got the old notion, Fred, that nobody can
get at us and that we can lick all creation. If Germany’s
hands were free she could land an army on
our coast, and before we could start to get ready to
fight we’d be licked. We’re like cake in an unlocked
cupboard, and Germany’s a hungry boy. We’d be
gobbled.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, say, Potter—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Think it over. The day’ll come when this country
will need thousands upon thousands of aeroplanes—all
of a sudden. When it comes it’ll be
sudden, and we’ll be caught. We won’t have an
army, we won’t have equipment—and we won’t
have aeroplanes, which will be harder to get than
anything else. That’s going to be my business.
Getting ready for the aeroplane end of it. And I
want you fellows to help.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ve been laying around too much, Potter.
You’ve been sick, that’s what’s the matter with
you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter shrugged his shoulders. “Think about it,
anyhow, will you, Fred? Great heavens! you’ve got
brains.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Much ’bliged,” said Fred. “Cantor, let’s be wiggling
on. We’re exciting the invalid. See you again
soon, old man,” La Mothe said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Cantor stood up and extended his hand. “When
you’re around again,” he said, “I’m going to bother
you. You interest me—about the aeroplanes....
And I want to see your plant. Making munitions,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” said Potter, “glad to show you around.”
He paused, and his eyes darkened. He fixed them
on Cantor and said, suddenly, “You weren’t fishing
up at the Flats about the time I was hurt, were you—back
in the marsh?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Flats? No. What are the Flats, Mr. Waite?”
Little points of white appeared at the comers of his
jaw. Potter noticed them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s nothing. I guess you got mixed up in a dream
of mine.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dreams are queer,” said Cantor, flatly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Damn vivid dream, though,” said Potter. “Come
again, fellows. My regards to the crowd.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Between the date of Potter Waite’s injury
and the first of the new year tremendous
events occurred at home and abroad, and among the
most tremendous, the most hopeful to Potter, and
to Americans who loved and feared for their country,
was the birth of the thing that came to be known
as the Plattsburg Idea. It was the one sign of life
in an ocean of lethargy; it showed that there were
men not unaffected by sinister manifestations—men
who foresaw peril, men who were ready to give their
abilities and their lives for the safety of the flag
that waved over their prosperity. When history
comes to be written the Plattsburg experiment
will stand out distinct, significant—a rainbow of
promise.</p>

<p class='c004'>Inert public opinion was preparing to stir. Germany,
pursuing her relentless way, chose to irritate
a nation which it might have conciliated. It irritated
with patent propaganda; her Bernstorffs and
Dernbergs filled the public prints with their sophistry,
while their paid agents were fomenting industrial
unrest and achieving arson and murder. German
bombs were discovered on outward-bound vessels;
the German torch was applied to factory and mill.
Irritation increased, became acute to such a point
that Doctor Dumba, who had used his sacred station
as ambassador to shield his activities as arch plotter,
was dismissed and sent on his disgraced way Vienna-wards.
Von Papen and Boy-Ed, red-handed, were
whisked away.... The <em>Arabic</em> was sunk. Then
it seemed that Germany hesitated on her course.
Mr. Wilson patiently indited note upon note, at
last wringing from the Imperial German government
its solemn promise to refrain from sinking liners without
warning. This was heralded and welcomed as a
great victory for our diplomacy, and the country
breathed more easily. The cloud threatening the
thunders and lightnings of war passed around us
harmlessly.</p>

<p class='c004'>But Mr. Roosevelt would not let the country return
to its sleep. His alarm-voice rang in its ears,
denouncing, demanding, stirring to wakefulness.</p>

<p class='c004'>The news from abroad had been depressing. For
a year the western battle-front had stood stationary,
presenting a stalemate. The heralded “big push” had
failed, or what one might safely call failed. Russia
was being beaten into helplessness with a million
prisoners captured since May. Siberia had been
stricken.</p>

<p class='c004'>But Bernstorff and Dumba and Boy-Ed had not
been without their value, as Plattsburg had not been
without its value. Preparedness was in the air. It
was a topic of conversation. It and the blind atrocity
of the slaughter of Edith Cavell.... The President’s
message in December dealt with preparedness,
naval and military, and promised much. Mr. Garrison
had a plan.... The inert mass of the people
was no longer inert; it stirred, moved, but did not
awaken. Perhaps it was vexed by nightmare visitations....
Henry Ford’s heart made his head ridiculous
with the squabbling argosy aboard his peace
ship.... All these things were straws indicating
not only the rising of the wind, but the direction of
the wind.... Potter Waite studied and appraised
them at their true value.</p>

<p class='c004'>He studied and weighed the manifestations of
public consciousness in Detroit, smug, wealthy, inaccessible
Detroit. Detroit was on no exposed coast;
Detroit was safe from invasion; Detroit did not share
the fears and the excitement of the seaboard, but
went on its way manufacturing motor-cars and munitions,
stoves and varnish, and piling up its wealth
fantastically, spending its wealth but never able to
exhaust its income. Submarine sinkings were academic
affairs in Detroit; bomb plots, the incitement
of labor to violent unrest, the torch of the plotter,
were matters that affected her more nearly. There
were those in high places who knew that the stealthy
eye of Germany’s army of moles was on the city;
that they tunneled underneath the city’s feet, sinister,
frightful.... But Detroit did not cry for war.
She demanded protection in her activities. Her
German-Americans were loud in their talk. The
hyphen had its definite place among them. Potter
watched and saw. Like the East, the Middle-West
was moving glacier-like toward a distant point. The
moment would come when glacier movement became
avalanche rush.</p>

<p class='c004'>Detroit continued to fly high.</p>

<p class='c004'>Long before the new year Potter had discarded
casts, bandages, crutches; his body was as sound as
ever it had been, more perfectly fit than his habits
had allowed it to be for years. There had been other
changes for the better—changes less easy to detect
and to define. One might almost have been justified
in saying that he had not gotten well of his injuries,
but had been recreated. There is a spiritual rebirth
which need not of necessity have anything to do with
so-called morals. Any changes apparent in Potter
were not due to his taking thought of moral considerations.
The only change of heart he had known
was with respect to his country: indifference had
turned to devotion. The great alteration was that
he had acquired an object in life; everything else
flowed out of that.</p>

<p class='c004'>The nature of him was the same. There were the
same dynamic possibilities, the same urge to action,
the same qualities which had formerly made for unrest,
recklessness, restlessness. His dynamo had been
creating electricity which must have outlet, and,
none being provided, took what freakish, ill-considered
outlet it found. The same dynamo was still
generating, but its product flowed evenly, with
stable force, along wires placed to carry it. What
had been turbulent potentialities were harnessed;
they had been harnessed by an idea, and that idea
was that the needs of his country demanded a certain
service of him.</p>

<p class='c004'>He went about his work not so much enthusiastically
as grimly, relentlessly. He was a man driven
by an obsession; that obsession was to clear the
way against his country’s call for aeroplanes. And
Detroit came to the conclusion that he was mad as
a March hare. There were those of his friends whose
nature it was not to pronounce unpleasant words;
these spoke of him as eccentric.</p>

<p class='c004'>One man, however, seemed to take Potter seriously,
and his name was Cantor. After his first call
he came frequently to visit, making his desire to cultivate
Potter’s friendship plainly apparent. Cantor
was, Potter judged, in the neighborhood of thirty-five;
a man of wide experience, whose eyes had seen
most of the world with a distinctness which enabled
him to talk of it as no mere globe-trotter could talk.
In spite of a feeling, not so much of suspicion as of
questioning, with which Potter regarded Cantor at
first, he found himself attracted by the man. This
was due, in its inception, doubtless to Cantor’s attitude
toward Potter’s object in life. There was no
doubt that Cantor accepted Potter’s clearness of
vision and was deeply interested in his plans. This,
an oasis of belief in a desert of skepticism, went far.
Then the man had undoubted charm. He was handsome;
his manners were distinguished and wholesome,
though a trifle foreign; his brain was acute,
active; his wit was a joy. In short, he was an unsurpassed
companion for a house-bound man. Potter
found himself liking Cantor more and more. He had
never possessed a close friend, a chum. It seemed as
if Cantor were to be a successful aspirant to that
position.</p>

<p class='c004'>But of all the events of that period the one which
had, perhaps, most significance was the return of
Hildegarde von Essen. Potter was being, had been,
modified by a number of momentous happenings
whose effects he was able himself to see. Hildegarde
was to modify him without his perceiving it. And it
may be asserted that her modification was the most
profound, far-reaching of all. It is the intent of
Nature that the life of man shall stretch over many
years. A third of these years, say twenty-five, are
used up in bringing him to man’s stature and in
equipping him with mental tools to carry on the trade
of living. At the end of this period he stands balanced
in the doorway, ready to step out into the
jostle. It is usually at this moment that a woman
intervenes. The most critical event of any man’s
career is the advent of some woman. This point may
be argued and combated, but not successfully. It
is critical because it is the major point of departure
in his journey. The character of this woman touches
every instant remaining in the man’s life, either for
good or ill. And it is all a matter of chance! Here
Nature does not plan. One might almost accuse her
of being sardonic. She shuts her eyes, shuffles together
a multitude of young men and young women,
themselves blindfolded, and then gives the word,
“Choose your partners.” Perhaps that is the fun
Olympus gets out of godship. It may be the whole
thing is some Olympian gamble. Upon this blind
scramble depends the future of the race!</p>

<p class='c004'>The marvel of it is that so many grasp possible
partners.</p>

<p class='c004'>Men are educated to choose a profession or business;
they are educated to enter a drawing-room;
they are educated to choose a hat or a cravat. But
to choose a wife—that choice which is so paramount
that one might almost say it is the one choosing of
his life, is not a choice of educated reason, but is a
blind snatch into a grab-bag. The worst of it is that
he cannot refuse to grab. Nature has seen to that.
For the perpetuation of the race she has given him
sex, and sex may bless him or damn him, she cares
little which, so long as she produces another generation.
It forces him into the game.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter had news of Hildegarde’s return from
Hildegarde in person. He was working in the old
hangar—the one to which she had come looking like
a fairy prince on the day of their disastrous flight.
It was now his headquarters, enlarged to accommodate
his needs. The building housed a reasonably
complete machine-shop, drafting-room, a combination
technical library, office, and study, as well as
the rebuilt hydro-aeroplane for which it had been
constructed originally. Here Potter worked, and
here his world was content to leave him alone with
his fad. Few visitors came, and these found themselves
unwelcome, for Potter was busy. He was designing
a motor that would be efficient to drive the
battle-planes of his country to victory.</p>

<p class='c004'>He stood now coatless, eyes protected by a green
shade, attention fixed upon his drafting-table. He
had not heard the stopping of a motor-car, nor was
his concentration interrupted by the unceremonious
opening of the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the use pretending you don’t know I’m
here?” said Hildegarde.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter turned abruptly and found himself without
words. He was not content to extend one hand, but
must stretch out both, ink-stained though they were,
and she took them boyishly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I just got home this morning,” she said. “Dad
said I couldn’t come and wouldn’t send me any
money, so I got a man to pawn some things and ran
away. I don’t think the man gave me all the money
he got—<em>quite</em>. Dad was furious. He almost <em>busted</em>.
As soon as he’d shouted himself into a state of collapse
and rushed out of the house I called your house
on the telephone. They said you were here, so I got
in my car and came—and aren’t you going to say
<em>anything</em>?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s you,” his lips said, stupidly enough, but
his eyes must have been more eloquent, for Hildegarde
said, with satisfaction, “You <em>are</em> glad to see
me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He was thinking to himself that his memory was
inefficient, for it had not retained so many of the
delights of her reality; it had forgotten the way her
little ears cuddled into her unruly hair; it had forgotten
that daring, challenging glint in her blue
eyes; he had forgotten something of that determined
line of her brows—a determined line which did not
give an expression of severity. He had recalled her
general appearance as one of some pertness; it was
not pertness, he saw, but keenness. She had seemed
a little girl—a rather naughty, wilful, impertinent
little girl; that seeming of youth was there, but it
was no longer the youth of the little girl with whom
one <em>plays</em> house—it was the youth of the girl on the
point of womanhood with whom one would desire
to <em>keep</em> house. She had been alluring, intriguing, as
he remembered her; in reality she was enchanting,
compelling, startling. She excited the imagination,
not physically, but adventurously. Potter had once
compared her to a dancing flame; he approved that
comparison. The inevitable conclusion to be drawn
from studying Hildegarde was that life in her vicinity
would be far from uneventful. She was full of dynamic
promise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I <em>am</em> glad to see you,” he said, letting her hands
go with reluctance. “I’ve been thinking about you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How nice! I’ve been thinking about you—wondering
how you came out of it ... if your nose was
flattened or one leg shorter than the other. Why,
you don’t look as if you had been smashed all to
pieces.” She laughed gaily.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll try to limp,” he suggested, “if it will please
you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She drew her shoulders together and became serious.
“I was afraid,” she said. “I couldn’t bear to
think you—were not the way you used to be. If
you had been crippled—and it was my fault! That’s
why I came so quickly. I wanted to know. You
see, I didn’t know anything—except that you were
alive.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“On the whole, I think I benefited,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>She looked at him quickly, appraisingly. “Yes,”
she said, “you <em>have</em> benefited. You look different,
somehow, and better. There was something about
you before that made me feel uneasy—not exactly
comfortable. Like a panther in a cage.” She laughed
lightly at her simile. “You seemed to be pacing up
and down and glaring at the world. That is gone....
Yes, and you’ve been behaving yourself, taking
better care of yourself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” he said. “My address is no longer the
Pontchartrain bar—and I’ve got a job.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That satisfies you?” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Something happened. Something has made a
great change in you. What was it? I’m interested,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The thing that happened was the necessity for
filling in several months’ time while I lay on my back.
It was necessary to think quite a little.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What did you think about?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The United States of America,” he said,
“mainly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t understand. Are you joking?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” he said, so seriously that she knew he spoke
of a momentous thing in his life. “It was the result
of the war, I suppose, and of little things which derived
from the war. The first thing I discovered was
that I was a sort of Nolan—a man without a country.
Have you read that book?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hadn’t done what Nolan did. I’d just neglected
my country utterly. I hadn’t bothered with it.
Just before I was hurt a man asked me if I loved my
country, and that rather started things.... I don’t
go around talking this sort of thing to everybody,”
he said with sudden reserve.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course not.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you ever thought much about it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No—I think not. I’ve rather taken the country
for granted, except when Dad has bellowed about the
fatherland and that sort of thing. Then I’ve been
stirred up a little. Irritated, I guess the word is.
I haven’t been an out-and-out American, but I
haven’t been anything else. That’s all.... Like
father, for instance. His father was chased out of
Germany in ’forty-eight, and you’d think Dad would
have a grudge against it. But he hasn’t. He gets
sentimental about Germany. He isn’t an American
at all, though he was born here ... and that never
seemed right to me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter nodded. “He’s not alone, of course, and
it is a dangerous condition.... Well, the thing that
happened to me was that I learned something about
the United States, and the first thing I knew I was
mighty strong for it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And what are you doing here—with all these
drawings and this machinery?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Aeroplanes,” he said. “Maybe you can understand
what I’m doing. Nobody else seems to....
Doesn’t it seem to you that we’ve <em>got</em> to get into this
war?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I haven’t thought much about that—not a great
deal. But nobody seems to want war.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. We’re smug and satisfied and cocksure.
But I think we will be forced into it. We can’t stand
everything. And if we go in it will be a tremendous
thing—for which we won’t be ready. We’ll be in the
position of a man with a hand-saw who is suddenly
compelled to cut down a forest. We’ll have to do
everything after the thing comes—raise an army and
equip it. And we’ll need aeroplanes by the thousands....
That’s what I’m doing—getting ready
for the time when we need aeroplanes. That is, I’m
doing what I can to help.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you’re not getting much help or sympathy,”
she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>He smiled wryly. “But I’m going ahead, just the
same. I hope we never need them. Maybe we can
stay out of it, and maybe we will stay out of it—but
I’m going to stick to this game until I know.
Because,” he said, with a sudden lighting of the face,
a glow of enthusiasm from his eyes, “it’s the best
thing I can do for the country—and I want to do
my best for it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She touched his arm lightly and in her eyes was a
glow caught from his own. “It’s fine,” she said.
“I think I understand. I’m going to understand better.
I guess I’ll be an American, too.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a rap on the door, and Potter, thinking
it was one of his machinists, called to come in. Cantor
entered, hesitated when he saw Hildegarde.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I beg your pardon,” he said. “I didn’t know
you were engaged.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come in, Cantor.... This is Miss von Essen.
You know her father, I think.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, indeed,” said Cantor, advancing, a graceful,
forceful, pleasing figure. “I didn’t know Miss
von Essen had returned.” His eyes were fixed
upon her boldly, but not offensively—admiringly.
“I have heard much of Miss von Essen, and
even saw her once at a distance. Since then I
have hoped it might be my privilege to be presented
to her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Even as he spoke he was studying her face intently.
He turned a sharp glance upon Potter, and apparently
was satisfied. In spite of his well-trained face
and manner, he had been unable to conceal a trace
of embarrassment, of uneasiness. It had passed unnoticed
by Potter. Hildegarde had set it down to
her unexpected presence.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Cantor is about all the company I have here,”
Potter said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I shall come more frequently now if surprises
like this are to be expected.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter turned to Hildegarde. “It was no end good
of you to come,” he said, “but really, you know, you
shouldn’t.... And you mustn’t come again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I shall,” she said, defiantly, “whenever I want
to.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll have to lock the door,” Potter laughed. “You
know what affection her father has for me, Cantor.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Indeed, yes.... But fathers don’t learn everything.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter pressed his lips together, for this hint of
something clandestine in his relations with Hildegarde
affronted him. He said nothing.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then the door burst open and Herman von Essen
rushed into the room, bristling, panting. He stopped,
glared at the little group, and pointed a trembling
finger at Hildegarde. “There you are.... I had
you watched. I knew you would come here....
It is like you, disgracing yourself. Have you no
brains? Rushing here to this man that has made
your name common in the whole city.... Out of
here, out of here while I attend to him!” He advanced
threateningly, but Hildegarde did not move,
only eyed him with level contempt. “You,” he
raved at Potter, “you entice my daughter!... By
God! I’ll show you!...” He advanced again, burly
fists doubled, Bismarck-like face purple and distorted
by rage.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the instant when it seemed the furious German
would rush upon Potter, Cantor took one step forward
and spoke. His voice was incisive, cold, compelling.
It cut through von Essen’s rage to his
consciousness and halted him. “Von Essen,” said Cantor,
“you forget yourself.” That was all. He stood
very straight, heels together, shoulders squared—the
attitude of an officer facing his company.</p>

<p class='c004'>Von Essen stopped, and his rage dropped from
him as if it had been some false face which could
flutter to the ground. He was <em>compelled</em>. Cantor’s
cool voice had a surprising, a powerful effect. “I—”
he faltered, seeming to grow smaller of stature, to wilt.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You will take your daughter home,” said Cantor,
still in that cool, commanding voice, “and you will
treat her as a gentleman treats a lady. Am I understood?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Von Essen nodded. He was inarticulate.</p>

<p class='c004'>“See to it,” Cantor said. “Miss von Essen.” He
bowed to Hildegarde, and, walking to the door, held
it open for her, standing cold and straight while she
passed her father and came toward him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Von Essen followed. He had the appearance of a
man suddenly caved in.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hildegarde paused in the door and turned. “I
can’t ask you to pardon him,” she said. “I shall
come again.” Then she preceded her father through
the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>Cantor closed it and smiled grimly. “You need
have no anxiety over Miss von Essen,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter shook his head. “That gets me,” he said.
“How do you do it, Cantor? In another minute I’d
have had to thrash that old bounder.... I’m much
obliged for the miracle.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He needs a little taking down,” Cantor said, contemptuously.
“These rich German-Americans get
too cocky sometimes. They have to be shown.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’d like to have your formula,” said Potter.</p>

<p class='c004'>Cantor changed the subject. “How’s the motor
coming?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Slowly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I haven’t seen the drawings,” Cantor suggested.
“I’m interested, you know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’d like to show them to you,” Potter replied,
“but I’m not showing them to anybody. I feel as
if it were government work, you know. I’m sure
you’ll understand.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Perfectly. I shouldn’t have suggested it....
Just dropped in to ask you to come down to the club
to dinner to-night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thanks. I’ll show up early. Want a game of
handball and a shower? Take me on?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ve been beating me too regularly, but I’ll
let you do it again. Maybe La Mothe and O’Mera
will be around.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Cantor walked out. As he got into his car he
shrugged his shoulders and smiled.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>As the door of the hangar closed behind them
Herman von Essen seized Hildegarde’s arm
roughly and propelled her toward his waiting limousine.
He was a burly, powerful man and lifted her
almost from the ground. She presented a spectacle
similar to that of a naughty little girl being led by
the ear; she trotted along on tiptoe with a consciousness
that she offered a most undignified spectacle.
People fail to reckon with the sense of dignity
of the young; it is very strong, and there is no surer
way to kindle their fury than to make them appear
undignified.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hildegarde’s cheeks were white, but her eyes, half
closed, were cold light flashed in reflection from steel;
she bit her lip to restrain a cry of pain. Her father
breathed heavily, noisily. She was aware that the
chauffeur, out of the corner of his eye, missed nothing
of the spectacle.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let go my arm!” she said, fiercely.</p>

<p class='c004'>He only shook her a little and shoved her forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’re hurting my arm! Let go!”</p>

<p class='c004'>She wanted to strike him, to scream, to bite and
scratch, but she knew she was helpless in his great
hands. She knew it was futile to struggle with him or
to appeal to him, she knew his rage was the equal of
her own in intensity, but she knew it was a brutal
rage, a rage which, if further provoked, might relieve
itself by some unthinkable action.... He was capable
of thrashing her. She knew it, but it was not
fear of him that held her passive; it was the effort
to maintain some vestige of dignity.</p>

<p class='c004'>He pushed her to the step of the car and, reaching
over her shoulder, jerked open the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>“My car—is here,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>He did not reply, but shoved her headlong into the
limousine. She fell on hands and knees, and he did
not help her to arise. She scrambled to her feet and
sat in the corner of the seat, pressing as far away from
her father as possible, avoiding any contact with
him. He shut the door with a slam and was silent
except for his noisy breathing.</p>

<p class='c004'>Both of them looked straight ahead, and no word
was spoken during the drive to their home. When the
car stopped and the chauffeur opened the door, von
Essen lumbered out and stood waiting.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Get out,” he said, roughly, not offering to assist
her.</p>

<p class='c004'>She stepped out, drawing away from him as she
passed, and ran up the steps.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wait,” he commanded, and she stopped. He
approached her and reached again for her arm, but
she avoided him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t touch me!... Don’t dare to touch me!”
she panted.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Go to your room,” he ordered. “Don’t leave it
without my permission, or I’ll lock you in....
Don’t leave this house again. Don’t step out of the
door. If you do—”</p>

<p class='c004'>She turned and walked away from him. She
wanted to run, but would not allow herself to run.
She walked slowly, shoulders squared, head up
proudly. She did not hurry as she traversed the hall
and ascended the stairs, nor as she opened the door
of her room. She entered, closed the door gently—and
locked it. Then she stood quite still, white and
slender, with a look on her face not good to see on
the face of a young girl. Her fists were clenched, her
arms held tense and straight at her sides. There was
no tear or sign of tear in her eyes. She looked not
like a living flame now, but like a slender image of
steel heated to whiteness.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hate him,” she said, slowly, not passionately,
but coldly, with calculation. Then she repeated it,
“I hate him.... I hate him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She took off hat and wraps and let them fall to the
floor, then walked across the room to her dressing-table
and looked at herself in its mirror. She saw
how pinched and white and strained she looked, and
bit her lip.... On the dressing-table in a silver
frame was a photograph, the photograph of a woman
still young. It was a strong face, a gentle face, a
face that in some vague way showed that the spirit
within had not been satisfied or happy. Hildegarde
lifted it in her hands.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You <em>married</em> him,” she said, in a whisper. “<em>Married</em>
him.... You lived with him of your own
accord—for years.... How could you? How
<em>could</em> you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hildegarde did not know that she herself was the
answer to that question. Born within a year of her
mother’s marriage, she had tied her mother to that
home and to the man who was the father of the child.
It had not taken years to disillusion Marcia von
Essen with respect to her husband; the first trying
hours of marital life had sufficed to show her the
sort of man to whom she had given herself, for he
had shown her none of that gentleness, that consideration,
that tenderness that form so sure a foundation
for the coming years. More marriages are
wrecked within twenty-four hours of the ceremony
than are wrecked in the succeeding twenty-four
years. Marcia von Essen’s was one of these....
She might have separated herself from him almost
at the beginning of their marriage, but time was
not given her to catch her breath and form the resolution
when was forced upon her the knowledge that
her thought must include a third being. So she remained,
and so, for Hildegarde’s sake, she endured
the years. “How could you?” Hildegarde asked.
The photograph might have replied, “For you, my
daughter.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hildegarde put down her mother’s picture and sat
down on the rounding seat in the bay window. Her
posture was girlish, childish; back against the wall,
feet on the cushion, she drew her knees under her
chin and stared out at the snow-covered lawn, the
wealth of shrubs swathed in white, down the slope
to the barren expanse of frozen lake. Her thoughts
were dangerous thoughts, and to a reckless, turbulent
soul thoughts likely to take material shape in
rash action.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I won’t stand it,” she said, in a whisper. “She
<em>had</em> to live with him, but I don’t.”</p>

<p class='c004'>That resolution was made. All that remained
was to hit upon the means to carry it out. She would
leave her home and her father, but how? And how
could she make it certain that he could not follow
her and drag her back? For drag her back he would,
she knew.</p>

<p class='c004'>She must have help; she must have a place to go.
Arrangements must be made outside that house for
her reception, and she could not go out to make
them—and she was penniless!</p>

<p class='c004'>“<em>He’d</em> help me,” she said, suddenly. “He’s got
to.” The <em>he</em> was Potter Waite.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was not with love that she turned to Potter,
for she did not love him. She was not a girl given
to sudden, unstable infatuations for young men.
But she liked him, she trusted him. Events had
coupled them in a manner which compelled her to
think of him as she thought of no other young man....
She would ask him to help, to find some way,
to devise some expedient. Potter was only a means
to an end in this affair—he was not the end. She
did not plan to elope with this young man; indeed,
that idea never entered her hot little head.</p>

<p class='c004'>She went to her desk and wrote:</p>

<p class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Potter</span>,—I can’t stand it any longer. I
sha’n’t live another day with my father. He’s a
savage and I’m afraid of him.” She was not in the
least afraid of him, but feminine instinct told her
this would be an appealing touch. Her hand traveled
to the arm her father had clutched and she became
conscious that it pained her. She stood up and removed
her waist to examine the arm. It was bruised,
swollen, rapidly blackening, and the marks of his
ruthless fingers were plain. She sat down to write
again. “My arm,” she wrote, “is nearly wrenched
off, and you can see the mark of every one of his
fingers on it. I’m locked in my room. Won’t you
help me get away? My room is on the lake side of
the house, the corner with the tower. If you’ll help
me, come to-morrow night about ten, and be careful.
I’ll be watching out of my window for you, and I’ll
be all ready. I won’t stand it another day.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She signed this, sealed it, and affixed a stamp.
Then she replaced her waist and concealed the note
in her bosom.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’ll have sense enough to know what to do.”
she told herself.</p>

<p class='c004'>She tried to read, but could not, and hurled the
book across the room angrily. She could do nothing
but brood and toy with her anger, keeping it alive
and pouring fuel upon its flames. Again she occupied
the window-seat and stared out at the wintry
landscape.</p>

<p class='c004'>Dinner hour came, but she did not leave her room.
She could not bear the thought of sitting at the
same table with her father, of seeing him, of breathing
the same air he breathed. Nor did he summon her.
She did not expect him to send a tray to her room;
that would be a courtesy so utterly foreign to him
that she did not even give it a thought. Besides, she
was not hungry. She could not have eaten. So she
sat and waited—waited for darkness and for that
stillness which tells of a sleeping house. When it
came she would steal out of her room and out of the
house to the near-by mail-box to post her letter to
Potter Waite.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hours went by. The house was very still. Though
she opened the door a crack and listened, she could
not hear a sound. It was after ten o’clock, and her
father was probably at the Harmonie Society drinking
beer and smoking those pudgy black cigars without
which he was seldom seen. She threw a wrap
over her head and tiptoed out of the room and
down the stairs. Very cautiously she passed along
the hall, but stopped before she reached the door of
the library, for the room was lighted. She drew
against the wall and stood very still, listening. Some
one was there, for she heard voices.</p>

<p class='c004'>Step by step she drew nearer, and the voices became
more distinct, her father’s voice and the voice
of a stranger. She believed it to be a stranger, for
she did not recognize it. Both voices were muffled
by the walls and hangings, yet she could overhear
what was said, if not wholly, at least in major part.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Boy-Ed and von Papen were clumsy fools,” said
the strange voice, “and this man Paul Koenig, that
got himself arrested the other day, wasn’t much
better. But those things were to be expected. It
wasn’t the ridiculous Secret Service of this idiotic
country that did it, even then. It was English
agents.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hildegarde realized suddenly that German was
being spoken. It had not surprised her or caught
her attention in the beginning, for she was accustomed
to hear as much German spoken in that house
as English.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you want of me now?” she heard her
father ask.</p>

<p class='c004'>The stranger did not reply directly to the question.
“Our men have done pretty good work so far,
but we must do much better. Our greatest success
has been in holding together the Germans here and
in creating in their minds a proper attitude toward
the fatherland. You and men like you have been
invaluable there. But we must take more vigorous
steps. A little has been done. We’ve stirred up a
lot of unrest, and we have the pacifists working
nicely.” He chuckled. “That I. W. W. organization
was made to our order.” He paused a moment,
and then said, significantly, “And there is quite a
satisfying number of tons of munitions that have
exploded here in America—instead of over the
trenches occupied by our army.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” said von Essen, “but what do you want
of me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“More help, of course. You recognize your duty
to the fatherland?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Naturally,” said von Essen.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Propaganda and singing societies aren’t going
to win this war for us,” said the stranger, flatly.
“For one thing, millions of tons of iron ore are coming
down these lakes, through the Sault Sainte Marie
locks, through the St. Clair ship-canal. That ore
makes rifles and cannon and shells for the Allies. It
would be a great service to the Emperor to interfere
with that traffic, and the surest way is to—er—discontinue
the use of the canals. That’s one thing.
Then Detroit is manufacturing more and more munitions,
and motor-trucks, and other things to help the
enemy. There’s a fine bit of work to be done right
here. You can be most useful here. You have influence,
and a man in your position will go without
suspicion. Do you see?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I see,” said von Essen, gruffly, “but I’m not going
to mix into such matters. I want to see the
fatherland win. I’m a German. But I haven’t any
intention of getting stood up against a wall and
being shot.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nonsense! You’ll be telling me you have scruples
against such a thing next. And you haven’t.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I haven’t,” said von Essen. “I’d like to see every
munition-plant in America blown to hell.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Excellent so far.... When this war is over a
German is going to be an envied man in this world.
Once a man boasted that he was a Roman citizen;
after we are through he’ll boast that he’s a German
citizen. Our Emperor knows how to reward service—either
with money or with honors.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t need the Emperor’s money,” said von
Essen.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But the honors, eh? Suppose you should be recalled
to the fatherland and ennobled, eh? Made
a count, let us say? You have the wealth to support
the position.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Uh!” grunted von Essen.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But to wear honors one must earn them. You
have been picked because you are the right man.
We do not make mistakes. We need you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” said von Essen, stubbornly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Listen, Herr von Essen,” said the stranger, his
voice changing its tone from silkiness to something
bordering on arrogance. “Last Thursday you rode
to the city in your limousine with Mr. Bradley. I
can repeat to you every word of your conversation.
It was an unimportant conversation, but I know
what was said. I can tell you what you had for
dinner two weeks ago, and what you will have to-morrow.
I can tell you every movement you have
made for months.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said von Essen, uneasily.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have not wasted time on you for nothing. I
say we need you—and you are going to do what
you are told.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. Why should I run risks? I’m willing to
help in a reasonable way, but this dynamiting
business—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Out of several hundred men serving the Emperor
in this country, half a dozen have been caught.
There is no risk, and there will be great gain. It
is not for you to refuse or accept. You have your
orders, Herr von Essen.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You can’t give me orders. I’m an American
citizen—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Bosh!... Last week there was an explosion in
an armory in a Canadian town not far from here.
It did quite a satisfactory bit of damage. I’m sure
the Emperor will appreciate it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That armory explosion—did you arrange that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I?... Oh no, Herr von Essen! <em>You</em> did.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I! You’re crazy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The records show—our secret records. You have
the credit there.... Now, Herr von Essen, will
you obey orders?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. What do your secret records matter to me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If I put information in the hands of the clumsy
American agents that Herr von Essen is excessively
pro-German and that it might be well to inquire
where he was the night of that so-called outrage, they
might be interested, eh?... And if it was hinted
that a search of your premises would unearth a considerable
quantity of explosives, and some extremely
novel and effective bombs and infernal machines?...
I should hate to do that, Herr.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But I was not where you say on that night—that
Friday night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, Herr von Essen? Shall I tell you where you
were? You were with me. Alone with me, as I
took excellent pains to see you would be. Nobody
knows where you were but myself—and I would be
unable to come to your assistance, of course. I’m
afraid there would be evidence directly against you,
however. It would look black for you if your chauffeur
were to swear that he carried you to a point on
the river and saw you meet two other men, and that
you had baggage which you carried, oh, so carefully.
Eh? And if he saw you cross the river, partly on
the ice and partly with boats? It would look bad.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hildegarde heard her father burst into a torrent
of imprecation, frightened imprecation. She was
even sorry for him. Yet she felt a malicious satisfaction.
He was trapped, neatly trapped, and he was
being made to suffer. She approved of that.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well?” demanded the stranger when von Essen
became quiet again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You couldn’t.... It wouldn’t be safe for you.
I should describe you and tell—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And how long would you continue to live after
that? Give a moment’s thought to that point.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is that explosive in this house?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Plenty of it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Yon Essen groaned. “What do you want me to
do?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Whatever you are told. You’ll get over this first
nervousness soon—and you’ll quite enjoy yourself.
Really, there’s a satisfaction in our work—when it is
successful. Are you going to be reasonable?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Von Essen made some reply unintelligible to Hildegarde,
but which evidently was satisfactory to the
stranger. “We’ll call it settled, then,” the latter
said. “I’m pleased for your sake. You will get your
orders in due time. In the mean while, stand ready
at all times to obey. Am I understood?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” said von Essen, in a voice from which all
arrogance, all courage was gone, “I understand.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hildegarde was filled with an intense curiosity to
see the man who had tamed and trapped her father.
The thing had happened so unexpectedly, and she
had followed the conversation with such interest,
that she had not had time to consider other than the
immediate aspects of it. She did not yet consider
her father as a traitor to his country, nor go deeply
into the meaning of the words she had overheard.
But she did want to see that man. She took a
careful step forward, and another. She would peer
through the door and then withdraw.</p>

<p class='c004'>She took one more step; then something descended
over her head, a hand covered her mouth, and she
was lifted bodily from her feet. There was no sound.
Whoever had seized her carried her silently to the
stairs, up to the second floor, opened a door, and set
her within. The door closed quickly, the key turned
on the outside, and she was free and alone. She
snatched the cloth from her head. It was her own
room!</p>

<p class='c004'>She placed her hand against the door to steady
herself while she collected her senses. Who had
seized her? Not her father, not the stranger. It
had been no man of her father’s who had done so.
It must have been some one in the service of the
stranger, but some one employed in the von Essen
household; some one familiar with it; some one
who knew without hesitation where her own room
was. It was startling, terrifying. She tottered across
to her bed and threw herself upon it, nerves aflutter.
Hildegarde was not given to nerves, but the tenseness
of her situation as she had stood listening to her
father and the stranger, with its unexpressed threat
of danger, then the sudden, stifling, paralyzing climax
of her seizure by unseen hands, had been sufficient
to shock steadier fortitude than her own.</p>

<p class='c004'>She did not give way to hysterics; did not whimper
with fear as some girls might have done. The
strange thing is that she was not <em>afraid</em>. It was not
fear she felt so much as bewilderment, a certain
dread of the unknown, a sense of something sinister
impending.</p>

<p class='c004'>She lay quietly struggling for self-control, and
gradually it came to her. She sat up and looked
about her. Then she went to her door and tried it.
It was not locked. This was startling, for she had
heard distinctly the key turned in the lock. Whoever
had placed her in her room had crept back to unlock
the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>She tried to consider the events calmly, first in
their bearing upon herself. She had been caught
eavesdropping, effectively interrupted, but not more
ungently than the circumstances had demanded.
She had not been hurt; apparently there was neither
desire nor intention to hurt her.... As yet. But
she had heard matters not safe to overhear. Possibly
her assailant knew how much she had overheard;
possibly he had come upon her suddenly
and had acted as suddenly. In that event he would
not know how long she had been there nor what she
knew. That would make for safety. Somehow that
phase did not worry her.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then she reviewed the conversation at which she
had been an unseen auditor. Its meaning was plain
to her. Her father was in communication with sinister
agencies, was now the tool of such agencies.
She had known him to be frantically pro-German, but
that he had been an active participant in the plots
and propaganda which filled the papers and which
people were coming to understand daily as more and
more of a menace to the well-being of their country,
she had not imagined. And now Herman von Essen
was to go farther; he was, so to speak, initiated into
the inner ring of German intrigue, that inner ring
commissioned by a conscienceless power to carry out
unspeakable designs against a friendly, unsuspicious
people! In short, she was the daughter of a traitor;
of the same blood that flowed in the veins of a man
plotting treason against the flag under which he had
lived and prospered and to which his allegiance had
been sworn.... She had hated her father before,
she despised him now. She was filled with shame,
deep, bitter, biting shame....</p>

<p class='c004'>She asked herself what ought she to do, what could
she do? She hated Germany because she believed
it was Germany that had produced her father and
his like. Because she had heard disloyal talk from
her father’s lips, she had become impetuously, girlishly
loyal to the United States.... But in the
condition that faced her, what could she do? Where
lay her duty? It was a question too complex for
her immaturity. She answered it by avoiding it.
Her determination was the determination she had
reached earlier in the day—to go away. Now her
going away took on a new significance. It took on
the quality of running away to avoid responsibility,
to avoid answering a question to which she could
see no answer.</p>

<p class='c004'>Once more she put on her coat and hat and crept
out into the dark hall. The clock had struck midnight.
This time she reached the outer door without
interruption, shot back its bolt, and stepped out
into the night. She ran to the street, fearful lest she
should be stopped even now, and felt a great surge
of relief as she dropped her note to Potter Waite
into the mail-box. Then she turned, and with as
great caution made her way back to her room,
locked the door—a thing she had never been accustomed
to do—and retired.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>It was mid-afternoon when Hildegarde’s note came
to Potter at the hangar. He read it, reread it, and
there was no more work for him that day. With the
letter in his hands he left his drawing-board and went
into his tiny office, where he sat down to consider
it. Perhaps not so much to consider the letter as to
consider Hildegarde herself.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a note in the letter to which he responded
instantly—an arousing note, a reckless note,
which called to pulsating life that heedlessness of
consequences which had always been so characteristic
of him. He could see her writing in white heat;
could picture her as she sat at her desk with the
smolder of rage in her eyes. They two were in
perfect sympathy, matching daring with daring,
rashness with rashness, unrest with unrest. Both
were driven by spirits that scorned repose, and a
hunger for untrammeled freedom of action. Fires
burned in both of them which threatened constantly
to burst all restraints. It required no mental effort
on Potter’s part to understand Hildegarde; he had
but to look into his own mental mirror and what he
saw there reflected her as well.</p>

<p class='c004'>One point required no consideration—whether or
not he would obey her summons. That he would
go was natural, inevitable. Had that call come from
an utter stranger he would have responded because
there was something in him that would have carried
him to the spot. But something stronger than this
natural urge of adventuresomeness called him to
Hildegarde, for regarding her he had reached an
ultimate conclusion. As he sat with her letter in
his hands he knew it was a conclusion from which
he would never waver; that a thing had happened to
him which was final; that something within him
had taken a stand from which there could be no recession.
This conclusion was that Hildegarde von
Essen was the woman produced by the ages for him
and for him alone. There was an element of fatality
in his attitude, some fragment of primitive belief
in predestination. She had come into his life, and
never could be gotten out of it. He felt, somehow,
that nothing could keep them apart.... He loved
as he did other things, recklessly, unrestrainedly,
perhaps with something of primitive savagery.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rage mixed with his other emotions. Herman von
Essen had handled her ungently; had pawed her
about, perhaps, with those huge, unsightly hands of
his. The mark of his every finger was on her arm, she
said.... Well, he would never do it again. Potter
wanted to go to the man and batter him to a pleading
mass of blood and bruises. Vaguely he hoped
von Essen would discover him when he came for
Hildegarde. That would be his opportunity.</p>

<p class='c004'>The thing that required thought of him was what
he should do with her when he had taken her away
from her father’s house. The obvious solution did not
occur to him at once—because it was so obvious;
because, perhaps, it was the thing he so burningly
desired.... Suddenly he leaped to his feet, his eyes
shining, his soul uplifted with sudden joy. He would
marry her; he would take her for his own. That
was a solution of all their problems.... In it he
neglected to consider her—whether she shared his
views of that matter or not. His sense that they
were predestined for each other made for that
neglect.... He would marry her, and then she
would be his to guard, to protect—to love.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter was not one to make preparations before
the event. In matters which concerned himself he
was not given to looking into the future, but to doing
the thing as it came to hand, and taking care of the
consequences that flowed from it as they should appear.
In a vague way he determined what he would
do when he had helped Hildegarde to escape from
her father’s house. His common-sense told him that
such escapades were looked upon askance by a
staid and plodding world; his innate chivalry and
decency and sportsmanship—and a solicitude for
Hildegarde born of his love for her—impressed it
upon him that he must take some steps to safeguard
her as much as would be possible from the wagging
of malicious tongues. Therefore, out of hand, he
determined to take her immediately to his own home,
to hand her over to his mother, and then to scamper
off for license and parson.... It seemed perfectly
adequate.</p>

<p class='c004'>He dined at home. As he was leaving the table he
said to his mother: “I’ll be home fairly early—probably
before eleven. I wonder if you will wait up
for me.... There’s something rather important.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course, Potter,” she said, no little amazed,
for it was the first request of this character she had
ever listened to from her son.</p>

<p class='c004'>He went out to the garage, put extra robes into his
car, and drove out into the street. Hours must
elapse before he could enter upon his adventure, but
he could not put off the starting; he had to be about
it. It was said of Potter that he was never late for
anything and usually was a little ahead of time—and
it was natural that he should be. He could
not bear inaction, especially if some event were
promised. He had to be moving toward that event,
or making himself feel he was moving toward it.
So he started at eight o’clock to reach a spot not
half a mile away which he knew he must not reach
before ten. It was his way.</p>

<p class='c004'>He drove past the von Essen mansion, turned a
mile beyond, and retraced his way. He scrutinized
his watch, and it seemed to him he had made no
impression whatever on the time that must elapse.
For several blocks he drove at a snail’s pace, then
he turned again and sped back over the icy pavement
at a dangerous speed. Again he consulted his
watch.... So for two hours he drove up and down
impatient, eager, unable to quiet himself. He must
be moving; there could be no repose.</p>

<p class='c004'>He saw Herman von Essen’s limousine drive away
from the house, half determined to follow it and settle
accounts with Hildegarde’s father. He was in a state
of mind which would permit of wild actions. But
he did not follow; instead he applied the brakes
savagely, skidded perilously, and headed in the other
direction. It was bitterly cold, but he was hardly
conscious of it; was conscious of nothing but a
seething impatience, a sort of breathless anticipation.
Again he looked at his watch, for it seemed as if he
had been driving back and forth for days. It was
only nine-thirty.</p>

<p class='c004'>As he passed the von Essen house again he peered
at it eagerly. There were few lights, and those dim.
The place was quieting down for the night; servants
would be in bed, or drowsily waiting for their master’s
return. Soon it would be safe to make the
attempt.</p>

<p class='c004'>After another turn or so he halted his car facing
toward his own home and at a little distance from
the entrance to the von Essen grounds. Snapping
on his dimmers, he leaped out and walked across
the street to the deeply shaded area midway between
street lights. Carefully he looked in either direction;
no pedestrians were visible; the street was clear
save for a distant automobile approaching from the
city. He hesitated a second, then stepped from the
walk into the sheltering shrubbery. With caution
he dodged from dark spot to dark spot, taking pleasure
in his subtle approach with a certain boyishness,
a certain pretense—as if he were playing Indian.
The snow reached well above his ankles, and at each
step its brittle crust crackled and crashed alarmingly,
but none seemed to take the alarm.</p>

<p class='c004'>He rounded the big house in safety and stood
under the window Hildegarde had described as her
own. There was no light. Potter crept behind a
snow-shrouded bush and scrutinized it, rising cautiously
to his feet and standing for an instant exposed
to view. If Hildegarde were watching alertly, he
said to himself, she would surely see him. He waited.
In a moment he could hear the window open.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Potter,” whispered Hildegarde.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>She disappeared, but came back presently, holding
out something black and bulky. “My bag,” she whispered.
“Catch!”</p>

<p class='c004'>He caught it and deposited it on the snow; then,
while he wondered how he was to get her down from
her room, she climbed upon the window-sill, lowered
herself until she hung by her fingers.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Careful.” he said, with incautious loudness.
“Wait.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But Hildegarde was driven by the same impatience
as himself. There would be no waiting for her, no
caution. She loosed her hold and dropped, falling
into a little heap in the snow. Potter raised her
quickly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hurt?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” she said, “of course not.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He picked up her bag. “My car’s just across the
street,” he said, and they walked hurriedly toward it.</p>

<p class='c004'>As they approached a black blot made by the
shadow of a clump or ornamental shrubbery, the dark
figure of a man arose, almost from under their feet,
and scurried away. Potter’s impulse was to give
chase, but Hildegarde clutched his arm.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What in thunder?” Potter burst out, angrily.
“Somebody spying on us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not on us,” said Hildegarde, bitterly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course it was on us. He probably saw me
sneak into the grounds, and sneaked after to see
what I was up to.... I wonder why.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hildegarde knew it was not a man who had followed
Potter, but was undoubtedly an individual
set by sinister interests to keep watch on her father
and her father’s house, but she held her peace. It
was a thing shameful to her and one she would keep
locked in the secret places of her heart. It strengthened
her courage and her resolution. She was running
away from her father because his proximity was
contaminating. “My <em>father</em>,” she was thinking.
“He’s a traitor, a plotter.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They hastened on, and both breathed in relief as
Potter assisted Hildegarde into his car. He pressed
the starter button and the cold engine started with a
staccato, uneven, protesting roar.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where are we going?” Hildegarde asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter shifted gears before he replied; then, of a
sudden, it occurred to him that what he had to say
presented some difficulties, and was, perhaps, of a
nature to startle his companion.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Garde,” he said, using for the first time the
diminutive of her name, “you and I have been
through some things together.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, indeed,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think they’ve made us better acquainted than—than
meeting at a thundering lot of parties and
dances and that sort of thing. Don’t you feel that
you know me pretty well?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you think I’d have written that note to you
if I didn’t?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He felt relieved. To be sure she must feel that
way. She must think well of him, must have a
certain confidence in him, to have summoned him
in this emergency.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where are you taking me?” she asked, a bit
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“To my house,” he said, and felt her start of
astonishment. “I’ll tell you why.” He hesitated,
and then blurted out, impetuously: “It’s because I
love you, Garde. I want you to marry me. I don’t
know if you’ve ever thought about me that way,
but I’ve been bursting with you.... Yesterday
morning when you came into the hangar I—I came
pretty close to taking you into my arms right
then.... I had to hold back.... The things
that have happened to us—doesn’t it seem as if it
were <em>intended</em> we should marry?... That’s why
I’m taking you home. Mother will be waiting
up—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Does she know?” Hildegarde asked, suddenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No. I asked her to wait up for me.... I’ll
leave you there and tear out after the license and a
minister. I can get the license fixed up all right.
The clerk is a friend of mine. And I’ll kidnap a
minister.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t I have anything to say about it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He stopped, somewhat aghast. He had overrun
his story.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Won’t you marry me?” he said, eagerly. “I
love you.... I’ll make you happy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was all unexpected to Hildegarde. She had not
reckoned on this. Not that she had never considered
Potter as a possible husband. What girl could have
taken so important a part in the happenings of a
man’s life without at least considering that outcome?
She liked him, liked him exceedingly, but she had
not thought further than that. She had regarded
him more in the light of an adventure; of an exciting
pal, perhaps.... Now she regarded him from a
far different point of view. He was asking her to
marry him—to turn her running away from home
into an elopement. Some girls might have been
carried off their feet by the romance of it, but not
so Hildegarde. She was not easily swept from her
equilibrium.... She was not calm and cool as she
considered; she was excited, vibrant with stirred
emotions, yet she could think collectedly.</p>

<p class='c004'>She liked him, she told herself, liked him very well
indeed. Perhaps that was love. She doubted it, but
then she might be mistaken. At any rate, he would
be a bully companion, and he was, she felt, trustworthy;
she could marry him with confidence that
he would be good to her, gentle with her, chivalrous
toward her.... He was rich. That was but a passing
thought, but it was present. He was handsome,
a husband to exhibit with pride.... And marriage
with him would solve her problem. She could depend
upon him to hold her safe from her father.
He would be a sure refuge in her emergency....
And what other refuge was there? She was penniless.
She would be alone in the world.... Unmistakably
she liked Potter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you angry?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you mean— Will you marry me? To-night?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” she replied.</p>

<p class='c004'>One arm sufficed to guide the car, while with the
other he crushed her to him, panting, protesting,
and kissed her averted cheek.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t!” she cried. “Don’t!” It was a shock to
her; it was reality, yet, somehow, she was not
affronted, was more startled than displeased.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You love me,” he insisted. “Let me hear you
say it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I—don’t know,” she said. “Everything is so—so
confused. Everything is happening—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course,” he said, gently. “I’ll behave myself....
But you’ve got to love me,” he said, with
determination. “We were <em>meant</em> to love each other.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They ran up the long driveway and stopped at
the carriage-door of Potter’s house. He leaped to
the step and lifted her out in his arms, and as she
felt the strength of them, the promise of protection
in them, she was conscious of a pleasant contentment,
of something more, perhaps. She looked up into
Potter’s face and smiled, nor did she avert her head
as he pressed his lips to hers. Yes, perhaps this was
love. Certainly she was moved, stirred by this young
man. If it were not love itself, she thought, somewhat
vaguely, it gave promise of opening into love.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Waite was sitting up for her son as she had
promised. When Potter and Hildegarde entered the
room she arose, surprised, but repressing her surprise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mother,” said Potter, “you know Garde, of
course.... We’re going to be married to-night—here.
That’s why I asked you to sit up.... I’ll
leave her with you while I run out to fetch a parson.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hildegarde waited, looking at Mrs. Waite with
reserve, expectancy. The older woman stepped forward
and took the girl in her arms as her own mother
might have done. “My dear,” she said. Then,
“Tell me about it, son.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter told all there was to tell, impetuously. His
mother watched him tenderly, understandingly, as
his face mirrored the emotions that moved within
him. She sympathized with her son, loved her son....
And she knew, as she watched him, that he
loved this girl, that it was no mere fascination leading
him headlong into ill-considered marriage.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you,” she said, holding Hildegarde at arm’s-length,
“do you love my son?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hildegarde looked back into those sympathetic
eyes, and spoke honestly. “I—don’t know,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Waite nodded. “No one knows you have
carried her away?” she asked Potter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” he said. “Nobody in the house, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is good. Perhaps she can get back as unseen
as she came. Because, son, you must take her
home again....” She held up her hand as he would
have protested with heat. “Listen, children....
I will welcome you as a daughter, Garde,” she said,
simply. “You will be very dear to me—if you really
want to be my daughter when you have had time to
consider.... But you haven’t. You’re marrying
Potter because there seems to be no other way out
of it.... That is bad, for him and for you.... I
hope you can come to love him as he loves you.
But whether you love him or not, most of all if you
do love him, you must go home. It never does to
start wrong; you must start <em>clean</em>.... Let us consider.
I’m sure you wouldn’t marry Potter until
you know whether you love him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’d do anything to get away from my father,”
Hildegarde said, passionately.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Potter,” said his mother, “you’ve been a wild
boy, but you’ve always been honest with me—and
tender with me.... For all that has been said
about you, I’ve never heard any one say that you
didn’t play fair. People have always said that Potter
Waite wasn’t the man to cheat or to take advantage....
You’re not being a good sportsman now.
You’re cheating—cheating Garde, cheating yourself,
cheating Mr. von Essen.... If you married
Garde in this way it would be a story to follow her
for years. It would be twisted, falsely told, garbled.
You would both know bitter regret over it. And it
isn’t necessary.... Hildegarde wants to leave her
home. Well, let her leave it without the breath of
scandal following. It will mean only a little patience,
only a little waiting.... Take her home,
son; then go to-morrow to Mr. von Essen, and ask
his permission for your marriage.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He would refuse,” said Potter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If he does,” said Mrs. Waite, firmly, “you may
bring Garde back to me whenever you are ready....
He must be given the chance.... But most
important of all, son, Garde must be given time to
know her mind. To-night she doesn’t love you. She
has been honest enough to say so.... I know that
hurts, son.... If she doesn’t love you, you must
give her a fair chance for happiness—you must win
her.... You’re not being a sportsman, son.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But, mother—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Would you marry a girl who doesn’t love you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He hesitated; he was unhappy, disturbed. “No,”
he said, “but—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But she doesn’t know. Is it right to marry her
before she knows?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter looked at Hildegarde appealingly, but she
dropped her eyes evasively.... He understood.
His mother was right, and Hildegarde interpreted
rightly the deep breath which he drew.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I sha’n’t go home again. You sha’n’t make me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You must, my dear,” said Mrs. Waite. “There is
no other place for you to go. You must see that
you can’t stay here.... It is impossible for you
to go anywhere else.... It won’t be for long, Garde,
if you care—not if you love him. But you must go
home to-night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I sha’n’t. I’ll never sleep under the same roof
with father again.... Oh, you don’t know everything;
you don’t know....” She could not finish.
She stopped, too proud to beg, feeling her utter
helplessness.... There <em>was</em> no place to go if she
could not stay here. She was beaten. Fiercely she
turned from Mrs. Waite to Potter. “Come,” she
said, furiously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Won’t you kiss me good night, dear?” Mrs.
Waite said, gently.</p>

<p class='c004'>Garde refused to reply, but flung out of the room,
followed by Potter. She would not allow him to
help her into the car, and sat in moody silence as he
started the engine.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You don’t have to mind her,” she said, suddenly.
“You’re not tied to her apron-strings.... If I’m
willing to marry you, that’s my affair.... I sha’n’t
go home.... We can go and be married some
place.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” he said, heavily. “Mother was right....
If you loved me—”</p>

<p class='c004'>She could not say it; even to purchase her freedom
from the home she hated, she could not bring herself
to declare a love she did not feel. Indeed, at the
moment, she believed she hated Potter, hated his
mother for her interference.... She was distracted.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You refuse to marry me?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll come for you to-morrow. I’ll ask your father
for you, and if he won’t give you to me I’ll break
in and take you ... if you love me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s your final word?” Her voice was sharp,
metallic.</p>

<p class='c004'>He nodded miserably.</p>

<p class='c004'>She did not speak again until they stood upon
the piazza of her own house and she was about to
open the door. Suddenly she turned on him, blazing
with white fury. “You coward!” she said, hoarsely.
“You quitter.... You contemptible quitter....
Oh, how I <em>despise</em> you!”</p>

<p class='c004'>It seemed as if she could not contain herself.
Suddenly she lifted her little hand and struck him
across the mouth; then, sobbing with rage, she
snatched open the door and disappeared within.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter stood rigid, livid.... For a minute, two
minutes, he remained without motion; then slowly,
very slowly, he turned away from the door and made
his way to his motor.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Potter Waite’s outlook upon life had been
modified by his accident and by that period of
enforced reflection which followed it; it was again
modified by the occurrences of the night when he
had first helped Hildegarde von Essen to escape from
her home and then had compelled her to return to
it. His first emotion had been one of seething rage;
this was succeeded by a bitter feeling that he had
been cheated, and he brooded. He had been cheated
because he had given his love to Hildegarde and received
in return for it a blow and her scorn. He did
not stop to think. He did not consider that she
was headstrong, impetuous as himself; he did not
consider the suddenness, perhaps the untimeliness,
of the proffer of his love. He did not comprehend
that Hildegarde’s words and actions were the result
of black disappointment; that her anger with him
was to have been expected of a girl such as she, frustrated
by him in a design which she believed to be
vital. Instead of weighing and reflecting he plunged
into a sinister mood.</p>

<p class='c004'>He became morose; the old charm and magnetism
seemed to have deserted him, and the men who
worked with him wondered what could have happened
to their young employer. A great part of his
conduct at this time was due to youth—to youth
hugging to its bosom and fondling a hurt to its pride.
If he had been indifferent to his friends before, he
avoided them now, made them feel unwelcome. And
he worked.... He drove himself, as a man will
drive himself who has riding upon his back the hag
of heartburning. There is no bitterness in the
world like that of sweetness turned to aloes, and the
taste of it was constantly in his mouth.</p>

<p class='c004'>He threw himself into his work, not with gay enthusiasm,
but with the smoldering fanaticism of a
Savonarola. There could be no middle ground for
him, no moderation. He thought and dreamed aeroplanes
before because he loved the work, because he
saw the value of the work, and because he believed
enthusiastically that his country required the work
of him. Now he steeped himself in the atmosphere
and technicalities of the aeroplane to crowd Hildegarde
von Essen out of his thought. Perhaps now
he worked more rigorously, worked merciless hours,
but it is doubtful if he worked more valuably.</p>

<p class='c004'>He went to Washington, where the Signal Corps
received him as a friend and gave him hours that were
near to pleasantness. Major Craig gave up his time
to Potter, encouraging him, inspiring him, congratulating
him. Here the attitude was the antithesis
of the attitude manifested toward him by those with
whom he came into contact in Detroit. He saw all
there was to be seen of the Signal Corps’ work and
plans and hopes, and was made to feel himself an
important factor. The officers who were his companions
liked him, but wondered if he returned their
liking. This was because Potter was for business
and for business alone; he held himself reservedly
aloof from the personal side. From Washington, with
imperative credentials, he visited such of the aeroplane
factories as were worth while and studied what
was in them to study. He was thrown into contact
with an Englishman of the Royal Flying Corps, recovering
from wounds received in air-battle with a
German ’plane, and from this man of real experience
he learned much of value regarding battle conditions,
and what an aeroplane must be capable of to do its
duty.</p>

<p class='c004'>These matters consumed weeks, but the time expended
returned its full measure of value.</p>

<p class='c004'>When he came home again the world was farther
ahead by much with its grim business of war; the
country itself was in a new stage of its transition,
and unrest, together with a growing realization of the
duties and perils of the position of the United States,
was apparent in the minds of thinking men. Germany’s
supreme effort to crush France at Verdun was
in progress, but staggering now. The Toledo blade
was proving itself able to cope with the sledgehammer.
At home there was reason to be depressed.
Military preparedness seemed doomed to failure;
Secretary Garrison had resigned in protest—and as
if in rebuke for our backwardness and shortness of
vision, our very borders were desecrated by contemptible
Mexican bandits which we were not in a state
to punish. Pershing’s futile invasion of Mexico in
pursuit of Villa was in progress, and disquieting
rumors were filling the country. The country was beginning
to seethe with the approaching presidential
campaign.... It was spring, and summer drew near.</p>

<p class='c004'>The talk on the streets, in hotels, in the clubs of
Detroit, was all of Mexico now; bets were heard
here and there as to whether Pershing would capture
Villa, and sporting wiseacres offered odds on the
fugitive. When the bearing of European events upon
America were discussed the conversation was generally
without form and void. The common attitude
was that we would not be drawn into it, but why
we would not, or how we would be kept out, or what
the whole significance of matters might be, nobody
seemed to know. There was a deal of bewilderment
in those days, not a little smug complacency and
asinine confidence in our immunity to such a disease
as war. Confused thinking was the rule, and the
clearest-headed could but grope and guess and find
such comfort as he could in hopes for the best. If
ever a nation in the history of the world was perplexed,
baffled, had not, in the phrase of the street,
the least notion where it was at, then the United
States was such a nation in those spring days of 1916.</p>

<p class='c004'>The nation did not stand where it had stood a
year before; there had been advances, imperceptible,
perhaps, to one not a close observer of popular phenomena.
But opinion against Germany was more
solidified; irritation was growing; everywhere you
encountered an attitude which seemed to say, “Germany
doesn’t want to crowd us too far.” Yet you
would have had to search long and carefully to find
a man who wanted war. Of course there was Roosevelt,
but, then, what else would one expect of
Roosevelt?</p>

<p class='c004'>Detroit, representing the attitude of the Middle
West, rather sneered at the seaboard for its nervousness.
New York had the jumps, one was told. In
New York people were really excited about the situation.
Detroit laughed. A thousand miles lay between
her and tidewater; she had no reason to sit up
nights worrying about the arrival of a hostile fleet.
She was safe, knew she was safe, and saw no reason
why anybody else should worry. She was safe, and
she was growing richer every time the hands circled
the clock. New York was never going to bully nor
frighten Detroit into any war-hysteria.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter was no more certain of future events than
the rest; but he was different in this, that he was for
insuring our property, as it were. There was a
chance, a remote chance, possibly, of the worst happening.
Potter was getting ready for that worst—and
if it failed to materialize, so much the better.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was living at the new Detroit Athletic Club,
that monument erected to Detroit’s swiftly acquired
wealth. His family was away, the Grossepoint
house closed. Here at the club he encountered the
best of Detroit’s opinion, and the worst; saw the
best of that spirit which was making her the marvel
city of the continent, and the worst of the consequences
of her tidal wave of prosperity. Here about
him was a curious blending of the conservatism and
gentility of older Detroit, with the new-rich, bombastic,
squandering spirit of the day. He saw millionaires
whose hands had not yet had time to free
themselves of the callouses of toil in the machine-shop,
whose manners were the manners of the corner
barroom, betting fabulous sums on the rolling of the
dice, at poker, at bridge—with opponents who
boasted that their ancestors had owned land in
Detroit since the coming of Cadillac. He saw boys
who had once earned their clothes by carrying
papers chumming with boys whose wealth had come
down through generations. He saw much that was
creditable, splendid, of great promise; he saw some
degree of that which was, perhaps, inevitable, but
was nevertheless deplorable. He joined but scantily
in the life of the club.</p>

<p class='c004'>He did not see it, did not grasp the fact, but it
was impossible that such men, riding on the crest
of a gigantic wave of prosperity, should think far
beyond themselves and the miracle that had made
them what they were. They talked of the Mexican
affair academically, as one talks of something in
order to have something to talk about. They discussed
the war with all the interest they would have
shown in a championship prize-fight—and most of
them with no deeper interest.... It was a world-spectacle
arranged for the United States to sit by
and watch—and derive immense profit from.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here and there, fortunately, were men of broader
vision, of abiding patriotism. One great manufacturer
was taking a salutary step in insisting that
every employee in his mammoth shops should be an
American citizen; one was purchasing space in the
newspapers of the country to advertise, not automobiles,
but preparedness. One man had the very
stationery of his firm inscribed with words which not
only showed the world where he stood, but urged
the world to step forth and do likewise.</p>

<p class='c004'>Whatever advances had been made toward presenting
a solid front, toward coherent thought, were
due, not to something moving within, something
spontaneous, some natural growth of patriotism, but
to Germany. Germany was awakening America;
Germany was America’s alarm-clock. Her propaganda,
her bomb plots, her labor agitations, her arrogance,
and her submarines were doing for America
what America seemed unable to do for herself....
Germany, while willing quite another thing, was
proving herself a friend to America; she was clumsily,
bull-headedly, forcing America to think together
and to the point; she was compelling America to
think about America.... That way lay the path
to patriotism.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tom Watts and O’Mera sat at table with Potter
one evening.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Potter,” said Tom, “I’m beginning to think
there’s something to this rigmarole you’ve been
talking. This deal at the Mexican border has shown
us up bad.... Something’s got to be done....
It got my goat, by Jove! that’s what it did. And
I’ll tell you what I’m going to do—I’m going to
Plattsburg this summer.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter made no reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s fierce, the state we’re in,” Tom went on.
“Why, what the devil would happen if some regular
nation landed an army on the coast—say a couple
of hundred thousand men? By the time we got ready
to fight the war’d be over with and we’d be cleaned
up plenty.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You make me tired,” O’Mera said. “Potter
with his aeroplanes, and now you with your Plattsburg.”
He looked up and nodded across the room to
Cantor. “Your snappy little friend is running around
a lot with that man Cantor,” he said to Potter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The von Essen girl.... She wants to go easy
with that boy—he plays marbles for keeps....
Rides with him, dances with him, eats with him.
None of my damn business.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It isn’t,” said Potter, sharply.</p>

<p class='c004'>O’Mera failed to notice, but launched into anecdotes
of Cantor’s adventures with various women,
each adventure cited to demonstrate a certain cold-bloodedness
in the dealings of the man with the other
sex—and a degree of success with the other sex
which Potter had not suspected.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s his principal occupation,” O’Mera said; “he
has some other one, I guess, but I’m darned if I’ve
ever figured it out. Handles money careless, too.
Must clean up somehow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Cantor merely appeared in the door of the main
dining-room, and, after looking around, stepped back
into the corridor. Watts drew back his chair.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let’s go down and knock the balls around
awhile,” he suggested.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Got a date,” said O’Mera.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come on, Potter.... I want to talk to you a
bit.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter nodded and got to his feet. They walked
between the tables to the door and out into the
handsome hallway. Coming toward them from
the elevator they saw Cantor and a girl; he had
evidently been waiting for her to come up from
the ladies’ quarters below. It was Hildegarde von
Essen.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter stiffened, but did not pause. It was the
first time he had seen her since she struck him across
the face and flung herself into the house the night
her flight was turned into a fiasco. She was unchanged;
she was the same slender, daring, challenging,
keen creature as before. Something she was
saying compelled a laugh from Cantor. Then he saw
Potter and smiled with surprise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, Waite, when did you get back?” he asked,
and moved forward with hand outstretched. Potter
was walking toward him. Hildegarde’s eyes were
upon him; he could feel them, but did not return
her look. He dared not. “I’m mighty glad to see
you,” Cantor said, as Potter took his hand. “Dined?...
Miss von Essen and I are just going to have
a bite. Won’t you join us? I’m sure Miss von
Essen seconds that.” He turned toward her, and
something in her look, her bearing, startled him.
She had grown pale, but her eyes glittered; she was
staring at Potter savagely.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Most certainly I do <em>not</em>,” she said, distinctly, and
turned her back.</p>

<p class='c004'>Cantor looked at Potter and lifted his brows.
There was the merest hint of a smile, a sardonic
smile. “What’s up?” he asked, under his breath.
“See you later, then.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter walked down-stairs in grim silence, his two
friends eying him wonderingly, neither caring to
speak. The Potter Waite they knew was accustomed
in such circumstances to prove unpleasant.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So long,” O’Mera said, hastily, at the foot of
the stairs, and disappeared toward the coat-room.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Guess I won’t play billiards,” Potter said, slowly,
to Watts. There was no other word. He turned
abruptly away, and Tom gazed after him, wondering
what it was all about. “Huh!” he ejaculated.
“What in thunder?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Up-stairs, Cantor was equally nonplussed. Hildegarde
walked to their table, drew back her chair,
and was about to sit down. Then she pushed the
chair away from her passionately, pushed it so that
it fell to the floor noisily.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t want to eat,” she said. “I’m going
home.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But, Miss von Essen—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m going home, and I’m going alone.... I’m
going now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is it? What have I done to offend—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing,” she said, ungraciously, and began to
walk toward the door. He followed her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I said I was going alone,” she said, under her
breath.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But—”</p>

<p class='c004'>She faced him suddenly, flamed out at him. “Go
away,” she said. “Have I got to shout at you?...
I don’t want you.... I don’t want anybody....
I’m going home.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I will see you to your car,” he said. “Careful.
People are looking at us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She walked rapidly to the elevator; it was as
though she tried to run away from him, but he followed
closely. They descended, and she disappeared
into the dressing-room.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Miss von Essen’s car,” Cantor said to the doorman.</p>

<p class='c004'>Presently she reappeared, and was about to leave
the club, it appeared, without noticing his presence.
He followed her outside and opened the door of her
car. She stepped in and flung herself upon the seat.
“Home,” she said, but did not look at Cantor. He
shrugged his shoulders and closed the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>He did not go again to the table that had been
prepared for himself and Hildegarde, but entered
the grill, where he selected a table in a distant corner,
where he sat biting his lip.</p>

<p class='c004'>“She’s in love with him,” he said to himself with
the air of a man making a mathematical calculation.
“Um!... All the better, perhaps.... Something
may be made of it.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Hildegarde had acquired the habit of stepping
softly as she went about her father’s
house; of stopping to listen before she turned corners
or entered rooms. Every activity of the house she
scrutinized with suspicion. She felt that affairs went
forward there under the surface which she could
only guess at but could not detect. There was a
sort of melodrama about her situation that keyed
her up. She would never admit it, but, nevertheless,
there were times when she really enjoyed herself.
There was no air of mystery about the place, but she
knew mystery was there. She knew there were servants
waiting upon her who were set there to keep
watchful eyes upon her father; perhaps they carried
on at the same time other and more sinister occupations.
Her father seemed to go about his usual pursuits
without interruption, but she believed there
were interruptions. Every time a fire worked its
destruction, every time the papers reported the havoc
of an explosion, she wondered if her father’s hand
had been in it. But she saw nothing to evidence his
guilt. Simply and baldly, she saw nothing. She only
felt.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ever since that night of climaxes she had hoped to
discover the identity of the man who had forced her
father, not against his honorable scruples, but against
his fears, to assume a part in Germany’s secret war
against the United States, but his identity was never
hinted at by anything that came to her ears or eyes.
Once, on some pretext, she had rummaged the basements
of the house to see if she could find the explosives
whose presence had been hinted at. She found
nothing.</p>

<p class='c004'>She listened for and searched for things she did not
want to find. “If I should find something,” she
asked herself, “what would I do about it?” There
was a problem indeed. One may despise a parent,
but, nevertheless, parenthood exists. She loved the
memory of her mother, and Herman von Essen had
dominated her mother’s life. Possibly her mother
had loved him. Surely she had loved him for an
interval. Considerations of this sort reared themselves;
but perhaps the major consideration was her
horror of disgrace—her horror of being shown to
the world as the daughter of a man guilty of treachery
toward his country. Perhaps she was not the only
daughter of German parentage who faced such a
problem in those days.</p>

<p class='c004'>As a natural opposite of her father, she had felt
loyalty where he exhibited disloyalty; his attitude
toward the United States had compelled her to a
love for her country which otherwise might have
lain as dormant as it seemed to lie in the majority of
men and women about her. But her father quickened
it, and she nursed it. It was not in her to do things
by halves, and inevitably she became fiercely, flamingly
patriotic.... Perhaps girlishly patriotic; patriotic
with immature enthusiasm.... She brooded
and dreamed. She saw herself frustrating her father’s
designs—but always without betraying him. She
pictured herself discovering plots, and bringing
them to futility with clever counter-plots. She pictured
herself in possession of indisputable evidence of
her father’s guilt, and would sit painting to herself
scenes in which she confronted him with it, compelled
him to grovel for mercy, and wrung from him
promises to abandon his sinister enterprises. But
though she spied with what cleverness for spying
was in her, she hit upon nothing tangible. Almost
she came to believe there was nothing tangible to
discover.</p>

<p class='c004'>The thing was never absent from her mind. How
could it be? One cannot whistle away fear, shame,
the sense of impending calamity which has its birth
in such certain insecurity as was hers. When a nature,
reckless, turbulent, headstrong—and feminine—is
moved by such emotions as hatred, terror, black
doubt, love of country, all conflicting, a dance, a
game of cards, a novel, cannot bring forgetfulness
nor ease of mind. It was wearing on her, chafing
at those restraints which were naturally irksome to
her. Hildegarde was being modified, as Potter had
been modified, but the forces that acted upon her
were far different from the forces which had worked
upon him. To Potter, through enforced idleness, unavoidable
thought, had come certainty and sureness
of purpose, darkened and made saturnine through
these last months by love that had come down about
him in ruins. To Hildegarde came only more uncertainty,
more anguish of mind. There was no
light ahead; nothing was clear before her. The
strain she underwent, the constant pressure of
suspense, the tenseness of a most singular precariousness,
all pulled her this way and that. How the thing
would end with her none could say. It would change
her; another woman would result, but what sort
of woman? The answer depended upon the innate
strength of her soul, the sturdiness of such virtues as
resided in her.</p>

<p class='c004'>For weeks after her brief encounter with Potter
outside the dining-room of the Athletic Club he insisted
upon obtruding himself into her thoughts and
multiplying her perplexities. She herself, if she had
been given to introspection, could not have told what
were her sentiments toward him. She was very angry
with him; that persisted. But the meeting with
him had given her a shock she did not suspect it
would give her. It had upset her. After she declined
so sharply to sit at table with him it had seemed to
her she had to get away from that spot; had to be
alone, could not bear the presence of a human being.
She did not want to hide away to think about him;
that was the thing she least desired to do. She
would have told you she never wanted to see him or
be reminded of him again. But she reminded herself
of him. There were times when she really believed
he had assumed such importance in her considerations
because she hated him. That, she fancied,
would account for it, for she was forced to acknowledge
that he was important. At other times she
was not so certain of hatred; vivid recollections of
pleasant, glowing moments spent with him would
come to her. Again and again she saw the look that
was in his eyes at their unexpected meeting. The
memory of that look disturbed and accused her, but
she would not admit the accusation. Against her
will she lived over again her flight from the house;
Potter’s offer of love and marriage, and her reception
of it.... She would have married him that night—without
love; it was not in her at that time to understand
why he had acted as he had; why he should
have declined to marry her without her love coming
to him as a part of the transaction. She liked to
fancy herself scorned and affronted, but in her heart
she knew she had not been scorned nor affronted.
She had accepted Cantor’s attentions because, with
a sort of childish petulance, she imagined it would
hurt Potter.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her reason was a double one, perhaps a triple one.
Potter was the first consideration; then, second in
importance, she must get away from the house, be
away from it frequently, be amused, excited. Cantor
offered amusement and excitement. She was not so
inexperienced that she failed to perceive early in
their intimacy that Cantor was not the safest of
escorts, that he might, perhaps, prove to be more
exciting than amusing, and more dangerous than
either. That feature of it rather egged her on. In
her state of mind she courted the risks she saw, and
dared them. It provided the element of contest
her restlessness demanded. She took on Cantor as
she would have taken on a game of chess, knowing
or suspecting the chances of winning or losing....
And she found him fascinating, a skilled cavalier,
a delightful companion—but a watchful, ready
companion, not likely to pass over the opportunities
of the game. It required all her wit, her
ready impertinence, to hold the man at arm’s-length.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the Fourth of July she drove with Cantor to
the Bloomfield Hills Country Club, adjacent to the
beautiful little lakes of Oakland County, distant some
twenty-odd miles from Detroit. There they lunched
and dined and played golf. In the evening there were
to be dancing and fireworks, but a sudden mood
seized Hildegarde, before the evening’s entertainment
was well begun, to go home. She could not account
for it herself. Simply she wanted to go home,
and wanting to go, she insisted upon being taken.
Cantor discovered that there was no arguing with
her.</p>

<p class='c004'>They drove along the country road to Woodward
Avenue, and through Birmingham, rapidly spreading
Royal Oak, Highland Park, that had grown from a
distant country village to a considerable city perched
upon Detroit’s very shoulder—on down the broad
avenue which had, but a few years before, known
neither pavement nor street-car. Through miles
upon miles of the most convincing evidences of the
city’s miraculous growth they drove—and for the
most part in silence. Endless rows of fine residences
where, as a little girl, she had seen meadows and
wheat-fields, did not now interest her.... She
wanted to be alone, alone in the dark. She wanted
to crouch in her room and to endeavor to compel
her brain to cease from thinking.</p>

<p class='c004'>As they approached the Boulevard she became
conscious of a tremendous glow in the sky toward
the west, a glow that seemed to rise, to pulsate, to
bound and leap fitfully. Cantor saw it, too, and
slackened speed. His lips were drawn; every now
and then he moistened them with his tongue, and his
eyes glowed with repressed excitement.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s a fire,” said Hildegarde, with interest awakened.
There was something about a big fire that
fitted into her mood. “Let’s drive across the Boulevard
and see.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll only get into a mob,” he protested.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Never mind. We’ll take that chance.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But, Miss von Essen, we may get shut off there
and held up for hours.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You needn’t worry, if I don’t,” she said, sharply.</p>

<p class='c004'>Cantor appeared more unwilling to obey her than
a mere fear of delay could easily account for. One
might have said that the region of the fire was one
he very obviously wished to avoid, but he obeyed,
nevertheless.</p>

<p class='c004'>As they drew nearer and were able to guess at the
locality of the fire Hildegarde said under her breath:
“The Waite Motor Company—it is about there.
Can that be it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t imagine so,” Cantor said, tensely; “their
buildings are fire-proof, I’ve heard.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But it is,” Hildegarde insisted. “I’m sure it is.
Hurry! It will be a tremendous fire. I want to see it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They turned and turned again. Before them lay
the great mass of the Waite Motor Company’s plant,
silhouetted against an eye-blasting inferno of roaring
flame. The fire seemed to be not in the motor-plant,
but to the rear of it.... They turned, made
their way through crowds of people, avoided reinforcements
of fire apparatus, and arrived at a point
where the conflagration lay before them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It seems to be a lot of sheds and things,” Hildegarde
said. Then, speaking to a police officer, she
asked what was burning.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Temporary buildings of the motor company,” he
said. “They were put up this spring as warehouses.
They tell me they were filled with motor-trucks for
the Allies, hundreds of ’em—and with parts and
supplies.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fireworks started it, I suppose,” said Cantor,
harshly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know.... Maybe so, but there’s a heap
of things happening lately that fireworks hain’t got
anythin’ to do with. Them Germans....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nonsense!” said Cantor, vehemently.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It isn’t nonsense,” Hildegarde said, sharply.
“They could lay it on the fireworks. That’s why they
did it to-day. I—” She stopped short and bit her lip.</p>

<p class='c004'>An ambulance came forcing its way through the
crowd, to be stopped close beside Hildegarde and
Cantor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh,” she said, “some one’s hurt.... See who
it is. Please do.” She turned to the policeman.
“Won’t you ask who is hurt, please?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The officer was obliging. He made his way to the
ambulance, assisted in making a path for it to proceed,
and then returned to the car.</p>

<p class='c004'>“One of the watchmen,” he said. “Ambulance
doctor says he was knocked on the head.... Hurt
bad. Says it looks like somebody hit him a nasty
lick. Skull’s cracked.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hildegarde shuddered. “Murder, too,” she whispered.
Then: “I’ve seen all I want.... Let’s go
home.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They drove southward to Jefferson Avenue and
eastward to the von Essen residence.... A car preceded
them through the entrance and into the
grounds. Hildegarde watched it, wondered who it
could be. It stopped just before them and a man
stepped out; he wavered, staggered, stumbled to
the ground, and Hildegarde heard him cry out with
pain.</p>

<p class='c004'>She leaped from Cantor’s car and ran to the man’s
side. “Who is it?” she asked, breathlessly. “What
is it? What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The man struggled to his feet, holding one hand
with the other, and answered through his teeth, as
one speaks who suffers agony.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s Philip, the chauffeur, Miss von Essen.
Playing with fireworks and got burnt pretty bad.”
He breathed sharply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come into the house quickly,” she said. “Mr.
Cantor, take his arm. Help him in.”</p>

<p class='c004'>As Cantor appeared the man started. “Steady,”
Cantor said. “Steady.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hildegarde followed them into the house. She
was frightened, she was doubtful. There was an odor
about the chauffeur’s clothing which was not that
of powder, nor was it exactly that of gasolene. She
was sure it was kerosene.... What did that
mean?</p>

<p class='c004'>As the man entered the hall he stumbled, cried
out breathlessly, and slumped forward in a faint.
Cantor and Hildegarde bent over him as Herman
von Essen came hurriedly out of the library.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s this? What’s the matter?” he demanded,
tensely.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing to alarm you,” said Cantor. “Your
chauffeur got burnt a little with firecrackers,
that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hildegarde switched on more lights as her father
and Cantor carried the man to a lounge. She could
see that his hands were badly burnt, but what was
more startling, more significant to her, was that his
lips were broken and bleeding and blood dripped from
a gash in his scalp, injuries not commonly sustained
through carelessness with fireworks.</p>

<p class='c004'>She peered at her father. Manifestly he was
frightened. He seemed to be looking to Cantor in a
peculiar manner, not as one looks to a casual guest
who is assisting in a minor emergency. Hildegarde
wondered at that look. The man jerked convulsively,
struggled to sit up.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Leggo!” he said, hoarsely. “Leggo!” Then he
saw and recognized Cantor. “Good job—” he began,
and then stopped suddenly, peering craftily at
Hildegarde. “Good job it wasn’t anythin’ but a
little skyrocket,” he finished.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hildegarde was standing tense, white. “There’s
blood on your coat,” she said, in a choked voice.
“Where were you shooting fireworks?” she demanded,
and looked from the chauffeur to her
father. Her father was still looking at Cantor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Go to bed,” said von Essen, roughly. “You’re in
the way here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I would go if I were you, Miss von Essen. This
isn’t a pleasant sight for you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t suppose that poor watchman in the ambulance
was a pleasant sight, either,” she said, her
eyes on the chauffeur. The man started erect.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s that?... What you say?... What
you mean?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Cantor’s hand was on his arm, and Hildegarde’s
eyes were sharp enough to see that his fingers crushed
in savagely.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Be still! Sit down!” he said, and the man obeyed
sullenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Go to bed,” von Essen said, savagely.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hildegarde was thinking, piecing together the evidence
of her eyes and ears.... Cantor.... What
had he to do with this? He seemed rightly to be a
part of it.... His manner when he spoke to Philip!</p>

<p class='c004'>“Will you go to bed?” her father said, stepping
toward her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m going,” she said, unsteadily, almost hysterically.
Indeed, she laughed unnaturally. “But
before I go—I thought you’d like to know about—another
great German victory.... They’ve burned
part of the Waite Motor Company—and murdered
a man.... Murdered a man!...” She turned
and ran up the stairs to her room.</p>

<p class='c004'>When she was out of hearing von Essen turned
savagely to his chauffeur, “What made you come
here like this, you fool?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where else would he go?” Cantor asked, sharply.
“No harm’s done.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s this about—a murder?” von Essen asked,
shakily.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Their damn watchman jumped me—one of
them,” said Philip. “Before I could let him have it
he landed on me—twice.... But I got him and
got him good.... For God’s sake aren’t you ever
going to do anything to stop this pain in my hands?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Von Essen was shaking flabbily; his arrogance
had disappeared; his cheeks were pasty.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ve got the nerve of a rabbit,” Cantor said,
sneeringly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Up-stairs, Hildegarde was listening, listening not
to what was being said down-stairs, but to another
conversation she had overheard months ago, the conversation
between her father and a man she had
never been able to identify. She was trying to hear
his voice now, trying to bring the sound of it back into
her ears so that she could listen to it and compare
it with Cantor’s familiar voice.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The summer and early autumn months of the
year 1916 were, perhaps, the least illumined of
any period of Potter Waite’s life. It was a period of
drudgery without encouragement, of restless, brooding
moods, of kicking against the pricks. There
were hours when he felt himself and his work to be
futile, when there was imminence of his return to
the old life of the bar, the cabaret, the club. With
the countenance and belief of one person he could
have surmounted it all easily; but neither countenance
nor belief was to be had of Hildegarde von
Essen. If possible, she was farther from him than
ever.</p>

<p class='c004'>If there were one element of brightness, it was his
realization of a change that was taking place in his
father. Potter watched it with hope, saw the gradual
movement of it, and read in it a token that other
men of power throughout the nation might be
changing as Fabius Waite was changing. Fabius
Waite was beginning to think about the United
States.</p>

<p class='c004'>It required a blow touching his own person to jar
Fabius from his foundations of Middle-Western
security and conservatism, but he was too big a man,
too able, too sound at the heart to continue to let
the personal consideration sway him. He was a man
to be depended on to view affairs in their larger
aspects, and to weigh them, not with respect to their
bearing upon himself and his concerns, but upon
the nation in which he had risen to the summit of
prosperity.</p>

<p class='c004'>The fire in his plant, of demonstrated incendiary
origin, gave him the initial impetus. Potter could
almost find it in his heart to rejoice at that temporary
disaster.</p>

<p class='c004'>Though the criminals were not apprehended nor
identified, Fabius Waite, correctly enough, laid the
fire at the door of German plotters, and he expressed
himself with less moderation than was his custom.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s an infernal, sneaking business,” he said to
Potter, “and a government which not only sanctions,
but deliberately buys and pays for, such outrages
is not a civilized government. Germany has thrown
its decency into the sea.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But,” said Potter, to egg his father on, “it’s
war. Your trucks were going to fight against Germany.
Hadn’t she a right to destroy them?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, openly, with cannon, or in a belligerent
country. We are not belligerent. We’re serving all
the world alike. If they have the idea America will
stand for this sort of thing—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It makes a lot of difference, father,” said Potter,
a trifle impertinently, “whose dog gets kicked.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Eh?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“This thing has been going on for a year or more—but
it never touched the Waite Motor Company
before.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Um!” said Fabius, eying his son and taking up
his paper. From time to time during the evening
he would lower his paper enough to peer over it at
Potter for a moment, and at such times it seemed as
if he were about to offer some remark.</p>

<p class='c004'>From that hour Potter was able to trace a gradual
alteration in his father’s attitude toward Germany
and toward the war—but most of all toward the
United States.</p>

<p class='c004'>During these months Potter worked not only on
the designs for his aeroplane engine, but upon collecting
and preserving information of general importance
to the manufacturing of complete aeroplanes
in enormous quantities. With all the facilities
open to a private citizen he made his inquiries.
Twenty millions of feet of the finest spruce must be
obtained in order that four millions of feet of perfect
spruce might be selected and sawed from it for the
frames of the aeroplanes. This alone was a gigantic
task. He studied the matter of obtaining linen for the
wings, millions of yards of it—and the best linen
comes from Ireland. It was a commodity of which
England could spare little. Perhaps there would appear
a substitute. Potter searched for it. Then
there was the matter of metal for the engine, and
the staggering problem of manufacturing a score of
thousands of such engines as Potter knew would be
required for fighting-aeroplanes—engines light in
weight, perfect in efficiency, capable of developing
two hundred, perhaps two hundred and fifty, horse-power.
As best he could he attacked these problems,
and stood amazed and terrified by the monstrousness
of them. It gave him that quivering, frightened
sensation one gets from thinking on infinity.</p>

<p class='c004'>At this time the country was learning an unrelished
lesson from the mobilization of our militia for the
Mexican border, from the performances of our brace
of aeroplanes, and from the apparent doubtful efficiency
of our machine-guns. Roosevelt was coming
into his own and deserving much of his countrymen
by his campaign for preparedness. War was in the
air, but war with a country far different from iron
Germany. It was a step, unperceived by most, but
doubtless clearly perceived by the man in the White
House, toward a day of greater preparations. Public
prints were demanding that we take half a million
men and sweep through Mexico, janitor-like, to
effect a cleansing. The Carrizal incident lit a dangerous
flame. The arrival of Germany’s undersea
merchant-vessel, the <em>Deutschland</em>, caused a wave of
admiration for Germany’s persistency and inventiveness
to sweep across the country. It was a victory
of a sort calculated to arouse honest admiration.
The second year of the war had closed with hope,
for Verdun was beyond peradventure a gigantic victory
for France, and the Somme offense had offered
proofs of the possibility of shoving the entrenched
German hosts toward their own frontier.... Italy
had heightened the hopes at Gorizia, and Rumania
had enlisted with the Allies.... November saw
the ending of the Presidential campaign with the re-election
of Mr. Wilson.</p>

<p class='c004'>Even before this, Fabius Waite had traveled far.
He was able in October, with the appearance of the
German submarine U-53 off our coasts, and its
entrance into the harbor of Newport.</p>

<p class='c004'>Fabius Waite struck his table a vehement blow.
“It’s a barefaced threat,” he declared. “It’s intimidation.”
He went on at length, and Potter
chuckled inwardly. To him his father represented
public opinion, and by his father he sounded it;
his father was to him the pulse of the nation’s
thought, and that pulse was beginning to beat
hotly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter was seeing much of Cantor, and, though
there were moments when he was jealous of the
man, for Potter’s nature was a jealous nature, he
was glad of Cantor’s company. Hildegarde was never
mentioned by either of them. By Potter she was
never mentioned at any time, and his friends were
quick to learn that mention of her in his presence
was apt to cause immediate disagreeable consequences.
The sound of her name had a curious effect
upon him. As one hardy young man said to Hildegarde
herself, “I happened to mention you to Potter
Waite to-day, and he acted as if somebody had
blown him out—like a lamp, you know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Bother Potter Waite!” she said; then, after a
frowning pause, she added, spitefully, “You might
keep a lot better company.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, Potter’s mild nowadays! Hasn’t been on a
tear in a year. Don’t know what’s got into him....
Dotty about patriotism and war and aeroplanes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why doesn’t he go across and fight, then? I
<em>despise</em> conversational courage.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He stands well with you, doesn’t he?” the overbold
young man said, with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c004'>The look she gave him somewhat dampened his
rashness. She did not speak, but her eyes were
enough to nonplus the young gentleman utterly. He
made haste to change the subject.</p>

<p class='c004'>In spite of the seeming obstacle imposed by this
young girl, the intimacy between Cantor and Potter
not only continued, but increased, but beyond a certain
point it did not go—and that point was any
disclosure of what Potter was doing or how he was
doing it. There, though Cantor veered up to the
subject obliquely, Potter became filled with reserves.
Cantor was unable to say of his own knowledge
whether Potter was working on an aeroplane or a
toy piano.</p>

<p class='c004'>One other point is to be noted. The men who
worked with Potter in the hangar were not strangers,
not picked-up mechanics, but men whom he had
known for years and trusted. Not one of them but
was American-born, and though numerous individuals,
presenting impeccable recommendations, applied
from time to time for work with him, none was
placed. His was a small, compact enterprise, and he
was able to keep it under his eye. Though he scarcely
considered himself of enough importance to attract
the attention of the German spy vermin, he took his
precautions as though he were of first interest to
them. He believed in insurance.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the latter part of the year Potter was visited
more than once by officers wearing the insignia of
the Signal Corps, Major Craig among them. To
these men, at any rate, he was of importance, not
so much, perhaps, for what he was doing at the time
as for the potentialities of the future. The heir
to the Waite Motor Company’s resources was a
man of value.... But as 1916 became venerable
and neared its end, they were compelled to admit
his present consequence.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I believe,” said a young captain to Major Craig,
“that young Waite in Detroit knows more about
aeroplanes, and more about this country’s equipment
to produce them, than any other living man.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Unquestionably,” said the major. “He has made
it his sole business to become that man.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you seen his engine?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No—only drawings; but he has added valuable
ideas. He has studied, and I can safely say that
his motor will be watched for with considerable
impatience. It has qualities.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Most enthusiastic man I ever met,” said the
captain. “It’s a fetish with him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s a religion,” said the major, “and that is
something mighty different.” Then: “He worries
me sometimes. Something unpleasant has happened.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Late in November the new engine was assembled,
not completed, probably, as it would be manufactured,
but perfected to a point where it deserved a
trial. Potter prepared for the test and, when all
was in readiness, wired Major Craig....</p>

<p class='c004'>It so happened that on the morning following the
day on which the telegram was despatched, Hildegarde
von Essen went to the rooms over her father’s
garage to carry certain delicacies to Philip’s wife, who
was ill. She remained until she heard the car arrive
in the garage below, and then, because she did not
want to meet the man, be required to talk with him,
whom she believed to be a murderer and a plotter,
she arose hastily and stepped out upon the stairs.
Philip was not alone; a stranger was with him.
Involuntarily Hildegarde stopped and listened.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This’ll be easy,” Philip was saying. “Softest
job we’ve tackled—no work and no danger. Just
set a charge and beat it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No watchmen? You have rotten luck with
watchmen?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s a man sleeps there, but he’ll be inside.
It’s just a wooden shack. Built it for a hangar and
then added to it. The boss would like some drawings
and papers out of the place, and he’s been after them,
but he can’t make the riffle.... He hadn’t expected
to get busy so soon, but we got a tip that
Waite had wired the Signal Corps to come on to
watch a test of the engine. Well—there won’t be
any test to speak of. That engine’ll fly without
any wings.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“TNT?” asked the other.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sure. That does the business.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“To-night, eh?... It’s a nice place to work,
’way down on the shore there. Nobody likely to
be passing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He must ’a’ picked it on purpose for us,” Philip
said, with a laugh.... “Eleven o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll bring the stuff?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Naturally. And you be on hand prompt.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who’s running this—von Essen or the boss?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What comes from one comes from the other,
lately.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’d love to be that watchman,” said the man
as he moved toward the door. “He’ll wake up straddling
a cloud.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hildegarde shuddered. Quietly she stepped back
inside the door, stood there trembling a few moments,
then opened it noisily and commenced to
descend. She nodded to Philip, who looked at her
queerly, and walked rapidly to the house.</p>

<p class='c004'>She did not go to her room, but threw herself in
a chair in the library. She could not be said to think
for some time; her mind was in chaos. But matters
arranged themselves before her after a time with
cruel clearness. Her father was plotting deliberately
to murder a man, for that is what it amounted to—to
murder a watchman faithful at his post. That
very night. And the watchman was Potter Waite’s!
This attack was to be made upon him, and the labor
which had meant so much to him for the past year
would be brought to nothing, destroyed by one blast
of devilish explosive.</p>

<p class='c004'>She knew what Potter was doing; remembered
those talks with him, his enthusiasm, his awakening
to patriotism—and she, too, was a patriot. That
work of his must have been of value; he must have
achieved much to demand attention from her father
and his companions. She was conscious of a glow
of pride, and then was furious with herself for feeling
pride. What interest had she in Potter Waite—and
if she had an interest in him, or in any honest
man, what could come of it? There was another
decision she had reached: That she could be wife
to no honest American. She, the daughter of a
traitor, could make no honorable man the father of
the grandchildren of a traitor. She had thought of
those children—and of their shame, and of generations
of shame that would follow them. The stigma
would follow from mother to children to children’s
children. Nearly a hundred and fifty years had
passed since Benedict Arnold sought to betray his
country, and his name was remembered, his treachery
recalled, where noble men and noble acts had been
forgotten. No children of hers should feel the
shame that would be their birthright because the
blood of Herman von Essen was in their veins. Such
a conclusion is a terrible thing for a girl like Hildegarde,
vivid with life, entering womanhood, ripe for
love and marriage! But it was there, weighing her,
overshadowing her, choking her with its noose of
blackness.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her duty was plain—her duty to her country and
to decent citizenship; but opposing it was the demand
of blood. To give her father over to the law
was unthinkable. Had it been thinkable she doubted
if she had evidence which would stand the test—her
unsupported word.... But she could not see that
crime committed, which it lay in her power to avert,
and continue to live.... It would make her a
party to the crime, an abettor of murder.... She
could give warning; she <em>must</em> give warning—but
how or to whom? How, without betraying her
father?</p>

<p class='c004'>There was but one answer that she could see—to
go herself to Potter Waite, to warn him, to beg
him to ask no questions as to the source of her information,
to trust to his honor and his chivalry.
She was confident she could trust him. In that
moment she laid aside the pretense that she despised
him—but she did not admit that she loved him. She
saw him as a man, an American gentleman, trustworthy,
brave, dependable. She rested herself on
that quality of dependability; felt she could trust
herself to it utterly. She could give warning; put
him on his guard, frustrate the plotters—and escape
from the complexity without betraying the secret
she must not betray.</p>

<p class='c004'>She dressed for the street, called for her car, which
she told Philip she would drive herself, and started
toward Potter’s hangar. She did not drive slowly;
could not have driven slowly, for there was a certain
frenzy upon her, driving her. Her car rushed along
the broad street at reckless, headlong speed. Scarcely
slackening her speed, she careened into the road
that led toward the shore and the hangar, slammed
on the brakes at the very door, and sprang out. She
did not hesitate at the door, but snatched it open.
Potter Waite was in the seat of a newer, smaller
aeroplane than the old machine of their adventure.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Potter,” she cried. “Potter....”</p>

<p class='c004'>He looked, sprang from the machine, and was
before her in an instant, his face glorified, his eyes
alight with joy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Garde,” he said, exultantly, “you’ve come!...
You’ve come back to me!”</p>

<p class='c004'>She shrank from him, put out her hand as though
to hold him away. “No,” she whispered, in sudden
terror. “No. Not that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But you’ve come. You’ve come. I’ve dreamed
it. I’ve seen you coming through that door.” He
stopped suddenly, stepped back, and the glory died
upon his face. He needed no words to tell him love
had not brought her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I had to come,” she cried. “There’s going to
be murder—here.... They know your engine is
ready—that you wired yesterday.... They’re going
to blow it up—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s that?” he demanded. “How do you
know I wired yesterday? Who told you? Nobody
knows that but myself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You mustn’t ask.... You must promise. I
can tell nothing—nothing except that they’re coming
to-night to blow up this place—to steal drawings
if they can....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“German spies.... You must believe me, but
you mustn’t ask me how I know. Promise you
won’t ask, or try to find out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not ask!... What do you mean? Tell me
again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“To-night this building—with your watchman—is
to be blown up. Some explosive called TNT....
It’s true. How would I know about your telegram?...
You must do something. You must
stop it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll stop it,” he said, suddenly erect, menacing.
He was not startled, she saw, not afraid. He would
be ready. It was so she knew he would meet an
emergency. “But you,” he demanded, “how are
you in this?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You mustn’t ask.... Isn’t it enough that I’ve
come to warn you—isn’t that enough?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” he said, “it is not enough ... if you know
these plotters. They are fighting against your country.
They are dangerous. If you know them, if
you can lead me to them, you must do it. Can’t
you see? It doesn’t matter what stands in the way,
you must do it.... For your country.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” she said, in terror. “No.... I’d rather
die. I can’t.... I <em>won’t</em>. I came here to warn
you, because I trusted you. I’ve done all I can....
You must not ask more.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why?” he asked, sternly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I won’t answer anything. I won’t tell you anything
more.... Oh, can’t you see?...” She
broke out furiously: “I could kill them; I could
see them tortured. I’d <em>laugh</em> to see them tortured....
I love my country as well as you do, Potter
Waite, and I hate them—but I can’t tell.... I
risked everything to warn you—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hildegarde,” he said, stretching his arms out
toward her, “was that why you came—was that
all? Wasn’t there anything else? Didn’t you think
about <em>me</em>?... I’ve waited for some word.... You
know you’ve never doubted that I love you....
You’ve had time to think about that night, and to
reason. You know I was right.... You can’t be
holding that up against me.” Suddenly he was the
old reckless, headstrong Potter, ruled by impulse,
driven by desire. He crushed her into his arms and
held her savagely while he kissed her cold cheeks,
her lips, her brow. “You’ve come,” he said, hoarsely,
“and you’ve come for keeps.... You’re mine.
You know you’re mine.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She struggled like an entrapped wild thing; but
her struggles were futile. All at once she became
limp, flexible in his arms; her tense soul became
limp, flexible; she had endured to her utmost, and
the breaking-point was reached.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hold me closer,” she sobbed. “Oh, closer—closer....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You came,” he said, and then repeated it over
and over again, as if he were suddenly face to face
with a divine marvel. “You came.” Then: “Has
the time been hard for you? As it has for me?...
If it had been you would have come sooner.”
He lifted her in his arms and held her as if she were
a child, and a warm, sweet feeling of comfort and
contentment covered her. She was happy with such
happiness as she had never known. “Tell me,” he
said in her ear, “tell me that you love me. I want
to hear you say it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I love you,” she said, obediently, and as she
said it she realized that it was true, had been true,
would always be true, as long as life should last.</p>

<p class='c004'>He laughed boyishly, joyously. “Shall we elope
again? Or what shall we do?... You mustn’t
leave me long. How soon can you come to me
forever?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Again the darkness descended upon her, the black
noose fastened about her throat. How soon could
she come to him forever? How soon? She laughed
strangely, and answered him with silence, but in
the leaden weight of that silence she was saying:
“Never.... Never.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Put me down,” she said, in a voice that compelled
him to obey. When she stood facing him, her knees
trembling, a look of such piteousness on her face
as made him draw a great breath of solicitude, she
looked into his eyes—looked with steadiness. “I
can never come to you, Potter,” she said. “Never.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He laughed. “Don’t joke, sweetheart. I can’t
bear that sort of joking now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s no—joke,” she said, brokenly. “I—I never
want to see you again. You must never try to see
me.... Never speak of this. I—oh—I can never
marry any man.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What?” he asked, sharply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can never marry any man.... You don’t
know.... There are terrible things—frightful
things.... I am defiled, defiled.... And I love
you....”</p>

<p class='c004'>She turned suddenly and ran from the room,
sobbing and panting as she ran. He did not follow
her, but looked after her with wide eyes into which
horror was making its way.</p>

<p class='c004'>“<em>Defiled!</em>” he whispered once; then he stood erect,
staring straight before him while one might have
counted to a hundred slowly. After that he walked
to the door of his private room, stepped inside, and
shut the door after him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>It had been with Potter as if he had stood upon a
lofty height surveying wonders and had fallen
with incredible swiftness through darkness to strike
the ground with frightful impetus. He felt the shock
of that impact as if his physical body had been in
collision instead of his soul.... <em>Defiled!</em> The word
was stamped in letters that burnt across his consciousness;
his brain groped and fumbled about it
as if it were some strange, monstrous thing no intelligence
could grasp. Every other created thing was
obliterated.</p>

<p class='c004'>That word stood isolated in the middle of his
universe, and his thoughts, mothlike, fluttered about
it, singeing their wings in its flame. There was no
coherent thought, only dazed consciousness of an
awful wound.</p>

<p class='c004'>There came a rap on his door, which grew insistent.
“Come in,” he called, mechanically, and a
workman entered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Everything’s ready. Maybe you’d like to look
her over before you go home.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Eh?” said Potter. “What’s that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The man repeated. “It’s quitting-time,” he
added.</p>

<p class='c004'>Quitting-time! It had been daylight when he
entered his room; now darkness had fallen. He had
been unconscious of the unraveling of time.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hey, Mort, telegram for the boss,” another
voice called from the machine-shop. Mort disappeared
and presently placed the little yellow envelope
in Potter’s hand. He opened it as an automaton
might have opened it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Leaving Washington to-day; arrive Detroit in
morning,” it said, and was signed “Craig.”</p>

<p class='c004'>For a brief interval Potter was careless whether
Major Craig ever arrived or not. The whole matter
seemed blurred, distant, as some vague memory....
Then came a sudden vivid clearness, a cold,
painful clearness, akin to that dreadful condition
into which arrives a man who cannot sleep. There
was a white incandescence about his perceptions;
something stark, sharply distinct about realities.
He leaped to his feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Call the men here,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>The men came in, surprise showing on their faces.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Boys,” said Potter, “they’re going to blow us up
to-night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The men burst into exclamation, interrogation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s our turn,” Potter said, and there was bitterness
in his voice. “German spies.... They’re
coming to-night. I’ve been—warned.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Perhaps he had it in his mind to make a request
of them; perhaps he had felt their loyalty to be such
as to require no request of him in the circumstances.
None was needed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“God help ’em if they come!” said Mort, savagely,
and he spoke for all.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They were going to send old Angus up with the
shop,” Potter said. There was no feeling in his tone
now; somehow he was without emotion. “Without
a chance for himself,” he added.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The damn sn’akin’ blaggards!” growled Pat
Cassidy. “L’ave it to us, sorr. Gerrman spies,
is it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They’re bringing explosives—TNT. Any man
that doesn’t like it can go home—and nobody’ll
think the worse of him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Pat faced the quartet of his fellow-machinists.
“Think the worse of him, is it? Is there a man here
which the white liver of him wants to run from a thafe
of a Gerrman spy?... There is none, sorr. We’re
all Amerricuns here, sorr, and, loike Amerricuns, we
stand togither....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you a bit of a flag, now, Mr. Waite?”
asked Mort. “Seems like we ought to have one
showin’.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s one in the locker, Mort. Run it up.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Wisdom would have asked the police for protection.
It is not strange that Potter and his men never
thought of that. It was they who were being attacked,
and they felt themselves well able to manage
the defense—that and a little more. It was a thing
characteristic not only of them as individuals, but
of their Americanism.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Lights out, except the lamp Angus keeps burning—and
keep quiet. I’ll stay here with Angus. The
five of you scatter around the place; keep hidden
and—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Give ’ell to anythink that comes h’along,” said
Cockney Tom.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Exactly,” Potter agreed.</p>

<p class='c004'>They armed themselves with implements of peace,
with huge wrenches, machinists’ hammers, bars, and
went out quietly. Presently old Angus, the watchman,
arrived. Potter would have sent him home,
but the old man felt himself one of them and entitled
to his share in the matter. He remained.</p>

<p class='c004'>Because of the isolated position of the hangar,
down on the shore of the lake, it was possible the
plotters might make their attempt at any time after
the normal hour for the activities of the place to
cease had arrived. Hildegarde had not told Potter
the hour she had heard named, so there could be no
moment during which vigilance could be relaxed.
Potter walked softly from window to window,
watching, listening. Resolutely he shouldered Hildegarde
out of his thoughts; the suspense, the impending
danger, made it possible partially to do so.
But not wholly. One might say that she stood upon
the threshold alertly waiting the slightest relaxation
of vigilance to slip in. And slip in she did
more than once—to be ejected after a sordid mental
scuffle.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter’s curious mental state persisted—that white
light of clarity which embraced everything. He did
not seem to have to reason to reach conclusions; if
one could conceive of flames whose temperature was
not heat, but frightful cold; if one could conceive
of those flames casting their vivid, super-brilliant
light so that it froze to ice crystal everything upon
which it fell, one might understand his sensations.
That and a silence as if the world had been dead a
million years—a sense of the dead silence of things
in which the dropping of a pin would have wrenched
and reverberated around the globe! It had a nightmare
quality which lacked only a horrid terror to
make it cross the hair-line between reason and unreason....</p>

<p class='c004'>Old Angus pottered about, a huge Stilson wrench
clutched in his hand. The others were invisible.
Potter looked at his watch; it was ten minutes past
eleven. In a vague way he wondered if it were ten
minutes past eleven on that same night or if years
had intervened.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was peering through a window that faced toward
the lake. Out of the obscurity of a mist arisen
from the lake emerged dark movement, and the
movement resolved itself into a black daub that
bore resemblance to the shape of a man. It was
followed by a second black daub and by a third.
Potter watched them, every nerve tense as the strings
of a violin. Were they his own men walking about
on sentry? He could not tell. He stepped softly to
the door at the opposite side of the building, opened
it silently, crept out, and made his way with cat-tread
around the corner, there to wait, crouching.</p>

<p class='c004'>The black daubs stole closer. There was not even
a whisper. One of them knelt beside the hangar.
There was a slight sound—the ignition of a match—a
shaded glow—then a tiny splutter.... Potter
knew. His guard had been passed; the enemy had
set its bomb, had lighted its fuse. He arose and
leaped upon the kneeling man, nor did he know that
as he leaped he shouted.</p>

<p class='c004'>The man upon whom he had sprang, surprised
though he was, resolved into dynamic action—soundless
action. Locked together they rolled over and
over. Potter felt the impact as another man leaped
upon them—but that other, in the murk of the night
and the fog, could not tell friend from foe. Again
Potter shouted. There were answering shouts. One
antagonist tore away and plunged into the mist;
the other, thrusting a savage knee against Potter’s
chest, broke the grip of his arms and rolled out of
reach. Both sprang to their feet, one in flight, the
other in pursuit. But Potter stopped. He remembered.
Close beside him spluttered that fuse. He
leaped upon it, seized it, hurled the deadly thing
toward which that spark was crawling, far in the
direction of the lake.... Now he was surrounded
by men—his own men.... And then came a
mighty <em>cough</em>, as if the universe itself had coughed
with all the strength of its hidden forces. There was
an instant of light and fire, the impact of an irresistible
energy. Stunned, deafened, blinded, Potter
was hurled to the ground....</p>

<p class='c004'>“My Gawd!...” said a voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter struggled to his feet and stood reeling.
“Are you there?... Is any one hurt?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>The men crowded about him, shaken, trembling.
They went inside and stood staring at one another.</p>

<p class='c004'>“My Gawd!... said Cockney Tom, again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They got through us,” Cassidy said, stupidly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Most got yuh,” Mort said, and cursed, “and us
standin’ around like bats.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s all right,” Potter said, unsteadily. “It
didn’t come off.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tom brought lanterns and they went out again
into the night. Between the hangar and the lake
was a crater such as a dozen men might have dug
in a day of hard laboring. They circled it in widening
circles. Potter stooped to pick up a hat—and
it was wet. At a distance Tom cried aloud, and
they gathered about him, awed to silence, for he
held out mutely a human arm....</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Tears did not sit well on Hildegarde von Essen;
one did not expect them of her. Somehow
it would have been more congruous to see her emotions
using some other outlet—swearing with intent,
incisive daintiness or dashing the bric-à-brac on the
floor. Yet she was crying, not dismally, with girlish
abandon, but with a certain dynamic intensity, a
clumsiness, if you will, that bespoke neglect of practice
in the accomplishment.</p>

<p class='c004'>She had returned half an hour ago from Potter’s
hangar, from listening to his claim upon her love,
from feeling the demand of his arms about her, from
a glad moment of surrendering her lips to his lips,
and from the blind joy of translating her heart into
words.... Thirsting on desert sands, she had
seen in mirage a green oasis where welled up a never-failing
spring of love; or, rather, it was as if she had
seen a veritable oasis, a living spring, and by her
own black magic had transformed it to mirage....
She had put away the man she loved and declared
herself defiled!</p>

<p class='c004'>That Potter had put upon that word a construction
far different from her own she did not realize.
Perhaps it would not have mattered if she had.
Could one choose between defilements? It would
have been impossible for her to comprehend an
obscenity which would have befouled her more than
her father’s treachery and treason had done....
And she wept.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was not in her to love with reserve, mildly,
sweetly, as it was not in her to live calmly, staidly,
circumspectly. When she gave her love it was with
fiery recklessness, holding back nothing, making no
compromises ... and that love had been caught
in the ruthless spring trap of a horrid reality, caught
and tortured and restrained of its freedom. The
fire-white cruelty of it was her knowledge that her
love could not die.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hours slipped by, one upon the heels of another,
and thwarted love took for its companion <em>fear</em>....
Potter was in danger. She had warned him, but
would her warning not bring him within the grasp
of a peril he would not otherwise have approached?
She knew it would. Potter was not one to leave his
battles to other champions; what was his own he
would defend. When those men came, bearing awful
death in their hands, they would find him there.
She could see him waiting.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then the massive house shuddered, windows rattled,
bits of glass tinkled to the floor, and a mighty
roar swallowed up the voices of the earth....
Hildegarde uttered no cry, made no movement, but
stood erect in the middle of her room, eyes staring,
fists clenched. She <em>knew</em>! They had succeeded, the
thing was done!... But Potter—had it touched
him? Had it mangled, torn, killed him? She had
but one thought now—she must know.</p>

<p class='c004'>She tore open her door, rushed down the stairs
and burst into her father’s library. Herman von
Essen was standing in the middle of the floor, pasty-faced,
unsteady, a man face to face with a vision of
horror.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What was that?” demanded Hildegarde.</p>

<p class='c004'>Von Essen gulped, started, opened his mouth
soundlessly, and then found stammering speech.
“I—don’t—know,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You lie!” she said, in a voice brittle, metallic.</p>

<p class='c004'>He stared at her, uncomprehending, and wagged
his head vaguely.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You lie!” she repeated. “You know what it was—you
know it was murder!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Murder....” he repeated. “No....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He was there,” she said. “If you’ve killed
him—”</p>

<p class='c004'>Von Essen shook himself together, peered at her
dazedly, seemed to grasp a sinister knowledge in her
words. “Who was where?” he snarled. “What are
you talking about?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Potter Waite was there,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Potter Waite!... What do you know—” He
stopped, stared at her as if he had not seen her
before, and his face grew livid with something menacing—the
expression of a rat driven into a corner.
He sprang upon her, caught her by the shoulders,
shook her brutally. “What do you know?...
What do you know?” he repeated, again and again.</p>

<p class='c004'>She tore herself free, backed away from him. “I
know that you are a traitor and a murderer,” she
said. “I know what that explosion was.... Don’t
touch me! Don’t dare come near me!”</p>

<p class='c004'>She could not hold him off. His heavy hands
clutched her again and drew her face close to his,
and in his eyes she saw terror and rage glowing side
by side. His voice was a snarl. “You know, do
you?... You’ve been spying.... You’ve been
listening.” He broke into German, searching the
language for epithet and invective. Then, “You
know.... Tell me what you know—everything
you know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know,” she panted, “that you’re a traitor to
your country, and a murderer.... I know you’re
a plotter, a German spy.... I know this house is
full of plots—and treason.... Your chauffeur—everybody
here is in it.... That watchman at the
Waite Motor Company—Philip killed him.... I
know that sound was an explosion—<em>your</em> explosion....
And Potter Waite was there.” Her voice rose
shrilly, “If you’ve killed him—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If I’ve killed him—what?” he said, hoarsely.
“What?” He did not wait for her to answer. “What
else do you know? Who else do you know?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know you and I know Philip.” Her eyes defied
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who else?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No one.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you lying?... If you lie to me—”</p>

<p class='c004'>She laughed. “I’d lie to you till I choked with
lies,” she said. “I hate you.... I despise you—my
own father.... You have done this thing ...
this horrible thing.... Benedict Arnold.... And
you’ve defiled me—I’m of your blood ... your
daughter.... Thank God mother is dead....
Yes, I’d lie to you if I had a reason. If I could only
tell the world the lie that you’re not my father!
You abominable, squalid traitor.... But I’m not
lying to you now.... Oh, I wish I knew more of
your kind.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He roared incoherently and shook her as if she
were without weight. “You know, eh?... Well,
what do you intend to do about it? I’ll shut your
mouth—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If—you’ve—killed—Potter—” she gasped.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll shut your mouth,” he repeated, and flung
her into a chair. Then he pulled shut the lofty
doors and paced up and down before her, muttering.
She did not cower, did not show fear, but crouched
there, glaring at him with burning eyes.... Ten
minutes passed—fifteen.... Footsteps, unsteady,
staggering, sounded in the hall. Knuckles rapped on
the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who’s there?” demanded von Essen, with the
catch of awakened terror in his voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Me—Philip.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Von Essen strode to the doors and flung them
open. “Come in,” he snarled. “Come in....”</p>

<p class='c004'>Philip, face blackened and bloody, stumbled into
the room and stood panting.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is it?” von Essen demanded in German.
“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Philip stared at Hildegarde and motioned. Her
father turned and scowled at her. “Never mind her.
She’s been spying. She knows. We’ll have to shut
her mouth.... What’s wrong?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We set the bomb—I lighted the fuse.... They
were watching the place. Somebody jumped on me.
Young Waite. Weimer jumped in and we broke
away. The place was full of men.... We ran.
Somebody grabbed the bomb and threw it....
Weimer was fifty feet away from me—and it struck
right behind him.” Philip shut his eyes and shivered.
“They’ll never find a trace of him,” he said,
shakily.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hildegarde sprang toward him. “Was anybody
else hurt?... Any of Potter’s men?... Potter?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” he said. “They chased us—but I got
away.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Were you followed?” von Essen shouted. “What
made you come here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was safe enough. Nobody saw me.... I
couldn’t go far. When I saw that thing land I
threw myself flat—but it shook me up bad.... I’ll
have to lay up.” He sank into a chair and covered
his face with his hands.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hildegarde closed her eyes. “Potter’s safe!...
Potter’s safe!” her heart was singing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll get you to bed in a minute,” von Essen
said, “but we’ve got to settle with this—this daughter
of mine—this <em>spy</em>.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Philip raised his head. “What about her?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“She’s found out things.... We’ve got to shut
her mouth.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He caught his daughter roughly by the arm and
dragged her to her feet. “You’ve meddled in something—”
he began.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hold on,” Philip said. “You’re going at it
wrong.” He turned to Hildegarde. “Miss von
Essen,” he said, “you wouldn’t give your father
away, would you? You wouldn’t do that?...
How’d you look in court swearing away your own
father’s life, eh? Think of that.... And you’ve
got friends here? How’d you like to have them
know? Get the idea?... We’d be tried for murder,
most likely.... Want to go through life with
folks pointing at you as a murderer’s daughter?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Traitor’s daughter!” she said, between her teeth.
Then, “Are you sure Potter Waite is safe—are you
sure?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I heard his voice shouting behind me....
Nothing touched him.” He watched her face intently,
trying to read its expression, to catch some
clue. “Now be reasonable.... You don’t want
the world to know, eh?... Or Potter Waite to
know? How’d you like for him to know your father
tried to blow up his place? Wouldn’t like it, would
you?” he finished, as he saw her wince.</p>

<p class='c004'>She fixed her eyes upon her father’s lowering face.
“Father,” she said, “if you’ll give it up—if you’ll
promise to stop this sort of thing—and be loyal ...
or, if you can’t be loyal, to stop helping Germany....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sure he will,” said Philip, winking at von Essen.
“We all will, Miss. Tickled to death to promise.
We’re about filled up with the business, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you had killed Potter—” she said to her
father.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But we didn’t,” Philip said, quickly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No—you didn’t.... And <em>he’s</em> my father. I’ve
thought of that ... night after night and day
after day.... I can’t expose him.... I despise
him, but even my country couldn’t ask me to expose
him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Huh!...” snorted von Essen.</p>

<p class='c004'>She drooped pitifully. His brutality, the stress of
the moments she had passed through, left her weak,
trembling.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your mother used to believe in a God,” said
von Essen, and there was the hint of a sneer in his
voice. “Do you take it from her?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I believe,” she said, simply.</p>

<p class='c004'>He strode to a bookcase, drew out a Bible, over
which himself and fellow German dabblers in materialistic
philosophy had wrangled, and thrust it
before her. “Put your hand on it,” he ordered.
“Put your hand on it and swear that you will never
repeat to a human being what you know about this
business.... Swear!”</p>

<p class='c004'>She drew back from her father, recoiling from the
thing he demanded of her. To her it seemed impious
that her father’s hands should touch that book;
blackly impious that he should drag it down into the
mire of his own unholy purposes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” she whispered, “not that.... No.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, I say.... Swear.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Philip stepped a pace forward. “Wait,” he said.
“You’re going at this like a bull. Have a little
sense about it, von Essen.... Listen, Miss von
Essen, this thing’s no joke to your father. You’ve
scared him, and he ain’t acting right. You listen
to me a minute. Here’s how we stand: If you blow
on us it’s more ’n likely we dangle at the end of a
rope. Just stop a minute and see if you want your
father dangling from a rope.... Not so much on
account of <em>him</em>, you understand, but on account
of—your mother....” He had seen the look on
Hildegarde’s face when Herman von Essen had
mentioned his wife, and a keen brain lay back of
his sharp eyes. “It’s her you got to think of....
If she was alive it would kill her, likely, to know her
husband was hung for a spy. Now wouldn’t it? She
was a good woman like you....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“She was good ... good.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“To be sure.... And folks thinks of her as
good. You got her memory to look after, hain’t
you? Well?... Wouldn’t folks begin to think
things about her if the man she picked out to marry
was hung, public-like, and the papers was full of
him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>She moaned and shut her eyes. She saw those
papers with their screaming headlines.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And think of <em>you</em>. After all, he’s your father.
Nobody expects a daughter to betray her father, and
nobody thinks any better of her if she does....
They’d say your father was a traitor to the country,
but that you was a traitor to your own flesh and
blood. I know folks, Miss von Essen, and that’s
how they’d look at it. They’d point to you and say,
‘There’s the girl that got her father hung.’ And you
couldn’t never bear that.... It’s a bad mess any
way you look at it, and there hain’t any way out of
it for you but to keep quiet.... Jest make believe
you don’t know anything. You’d catch it double,
Miss. Once for givin’ away your father, and
once for bein’ the daughter of a spy that was hung....
Your mother would ’a’ stood by him like it
was her duty to do. Bein’ as she’s gone, you’re sort
of in her place....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mother,” Hildegarde said, in a voice so low there
was almost no sound above a breath. She bowed
and touched her lips to the cold leather. “I swear,”
she said.... “And now may I go? I’m—so—tired.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let me help you to your room, Miss,” said Philip,
but she would not let him touch her, and tottered
up the stairs alone.</p>

<p class='c004'>When she was gone von Essen turned apprehensive
eyes upon his chauffeur. Philip shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t need to worry about her,” he said. “That
sort of thing means a heap to a woman.... She’s
safe.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Potter Waite appeared in the morning
papers in a new character, and in his new
character occupied even more space and bigger headlines
than he had ever conquered in the old. Capable
reporters had found a story to their liking, and,
what was more, a story with extraordinary news
value and interest to the public. It was not merely a
local story, but one of a sort which some newspaper
men call “A. P. stuff.” It is not the duty of a reporter
to assist in hiding anybody’s light under a
bushel, to minimize heroism or rascality. Quite the
contrary. He polishes his hero’s armor; he darkens
the shadows about his miscreant.</p>

<p class='c004'>So Potter was held up to public view as a hero of
sorts, and it is characteristic of the public that there
were few to run back through the index of memory
and drag to light those closed pages of reckless deviltry,
of gaudy misbehavior. Potter had won for himself
a new character.</p>

<p class='c004'>Doubtless there were some devout enthusiasts who
held him a convert; a captive dragged up the sawdust
trail at Billy Sunday’s chariot wheel, for Billy
had, since early September, been belaboring the
devil and torturing the English language in his
huge tabernacle on Grindley Field—once the athletic
domain of the parent Detroit Athletic Club. Billy
had ranted to the glory of God and the discomfiture
of evil, and gone his way, leaving behind him a state
which, on its November election-day, voted the
abolition of traffic in intoxicants. Perhaps Billy
claimed the credit for both Potter’s renovated character
and the coming drought. There is some justice
in his claim to a fair share in the latter.</p>

<p class='c004'>Major Craig and his two companions read the
papers in the spacious reading-room of the Athletic
Club where Potter had put them up, reading with a
grain of salt at hand, for military men suspect the
utterances of the press, but not underestimating the
main fact—that Potter was a fighting-man and had
done eagerly what battle was offered him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If Waite’s engine has as good stuff in it as he
has in himself,” the major said to Captain Ball,
“our trip will be worth while.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He seemed a capable chap,” said Ball, who had
met Potter in Washington, “but offish.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Something’s eating the boy,” said the major—and
then arose with extended hand as Potter entered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where’s the laurel wreath?” he asked, with a
smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>“My men were so proud of themselves that they
had to blab,” Potter said, dismally. “They had to
do a bit of bragging.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It looks as if they were proud of you—and their
bragging was about their boss.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter smiled wryly, “Yes, confound them!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s a valuable quality—to be able to capture the
liking of the men who work for you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They’re good men, mighty good men.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter was shaking hands with Captain Ball and
Lieutenant Emmons. “Have you breakfasted?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All ready to go with you,” said the major. “They
really did no damage?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The men are busy replacing broken glass, that’s
all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Presently they were driving through back streets
toward Jefferson Avenue, and out that broad thoroughfare
to Potter’s workshop.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hope you won’t be disappointed in the looks
of my motor,” Potter said. “It’s rough—not finished
up and polished like these European aeroplane motors.
I planned with the idea of a quick and large
production, and cut out all folderols.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He led the way to the machine, and for a couple
of hours the Signal Corps men studied it with technical
minuteness and precision. They missed no
valve, no bolt, no lock-nut.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Develops a two-hundred horse-power?” asked
Captain Ball.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A fraction over.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The room was filled with smoke and fumes from
the exhaust of the roaring motor. Potter motioned
for doors and windows to be opened.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The ’plane is a bit clumsy,” he said, “but it will
show what the motor can do.... And to-day’s as
fine for a flight as we’ve had this fall. Will you
trust your neck with me, Major?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The major climbed into the passenger’s seat
without a word. The machine was wheeled out, its
propeller began to mangle the air, and the craft
dropped the earth with a sort of gentle suddenness.
Out over the sparkling lake they sped, attaining
greater altitude and wafting miles behind them as
with a breath. Beautifully, powerfully, rhythmically
the motor labored, and the major’s eyes glowed as
his skilled brain took note of the performance, analyzing
and appraising it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly Potter veered to the northward, taking
a course he had followed once before with a quite
different passenger—a fairy prince—for companion.
In a time unbelievably short they were over the piers
and the panorama of the Flats expanded before them.
Potter descended, veered again over Muscamoot,
flew lower and lower. He was looking for something.
A couple of hundred feet above the ground he
skimmed—and then he saw. Just at his right lay
an island, an island he recognized. Dingy buildings
were visible.... There was the channel where he
had tried to land his hydroplane—there was the tree
against which they had brushed, and the broken
branches hung as a testimony to the fact. There
was no sign of life.</p>

<p class='c004'>But Potter was satisfied. He knew that his dream
had been no dream. None could convince him now
that his ’plane had fallen on the distant shores of
Baltimore Bay. He knew! He knew that beneath
him lay the spot where he had crashed to earth; he
knew that himself, his companion, his machine, had
been conveyed, at great expenditure of labor, to a
distance.... He knew there must have been a
reason, but what reason?</p>

<p class='c004'>Cantor.... That point was vague. There was
no evidence in support of that vague memory. Had
Cantor bent over him as he lay? Had he seen the
face of the man who had become his close acquaintance
on that lonely island enfolded in the heart
of a great marsh? If the main fact were true the
subordinate fact might be true as well.... The
whole matter was <em>outré</em>, bizarre, sinister.</p>

<p class='c004'>Once more the machine veered, banked skilfully
and throbbed cityward. It descended in a not over
skilful landing and bounded clumsily until it subsided
into motionlessness.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I brought him back safely,” Potter called to the
captain.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And,” said Major Craig, with quiet satisfaction,
“I’ve ridden with a motor.... You’ve got a motor,
Mr. Waite.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You think so?... You think it will be worth
something?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course this has been no real test, but you’ve
shown enough to make a real test necessary. I
believe this motor of yours is far and away the best
motor for its purpose in America. That’s something.
But over there, Mr. Waite, improvements are made
overnight that render existing types obsolete. The
’planes of six months ago are antediluvian. The
’planes of a year hence will be—nobody knows what.
But you’ve got something, something to work from,
anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Speed,” said Captain Ball, succinctly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This ’plane doesn’t give the motor a chance,”
said Potter. “With one of those little French fighting-machines
I think I could show you speed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Craig nodded. Then Potter and the officers immersed
themselves in technicalities of weight per
horse-power, lubrication, machining, high altitude,
and such future matters as standardization, possible
output, time of manufacture. With these matters
the day passed.</p>

<p class='c004'>They dined at the club. At the table next on their
right sat Fred La Mothe and a young man, of recent
prosperity, named Roper. Potter called across:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hear your father has bought a new Whistler,
Fred?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’s all puffed up over it,” Fred said, with a
laugh.</p>

<p class='c004'>Roper was applying himself to a steak. He lifted
his face and said, “Whistler, did you say?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s a new car on me. Where’s it made?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The production is very small,” said Fred, without
a smile. “Mostly they come from Europe.”</p>

<p class='c004'>That represented one phase of Detroit, the part
of it which had grown so rapidly it had shot past
certain stations on the way without so much as a
knowledge of their existence. It was producing
lopsided men. Roper did not know Whistler, probably
had never heard of Meredith, was too busy
to understand or care that his speech was crude,
sometimes vulgar, always studded with solecisms;
yet a great motor company found his knowledge of
production in bulk such that it gladly paid him
twenty-five thousand dollars a year for the use of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Supposing,” said the major, “that we should
need this twenty-five thousand aeroplanes next year.
If events should shape themselves so that we were
drawn into the war in the spring, how long would it
be before we could hope for deliveries?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I imagine you are better equipped to answer that
than I,” said Potter. “A great deal depends on the
start. If a motor were adopted and orders given <em>now</em>,
we could probably begin making deliveries in six
or seven months—if we were assured the material
and the labor—and if factories could be found to
equip for their manufacture?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you any doubts of that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve estimated that the initial cost of equipping
my father’s plant to make engines alone will be
upward of half a million dollars,” Potter said. “I
don’t know how he would feel about going ahead to
that extent. Six months ago I would have said he
would never consider it. Now I rather believe he
would.... Some manufacturers here would jump
at the opportunity—from patriotic motives—without
a thought of profit. Others would have to be shown
where the profit was.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Would cost and ten per cent. interest them?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you could get them waked up. You’d have to
get them to think less about themselves and more
about the country.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But don’t you think a change is taking place in
public opinion?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter paused before replying. “Yes,” he said.
“There has been a change, a slow movement.
Right now I wouldn’t even guess how far it had
traveled.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The major leaned back in his chair and gazed at
the table-cloth; his companions did not speak. At
the next table two men in the prime of their middle
age were talking in tones louder than one expects
in such a place. But these men were privileged.
Both were millionaires; both were manufacturers
of automobiles; both had worked, less than twenty
years ago, as machinists at the bench. They were
big men, rough men, but able men.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This gin they serve here can’t be touched in
town,” said the heavier of the two.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s bully.... Reminds me, are you getting
ready for the long thirst, Bob?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You can lay a sweet bet on that. I’m planting
enough in the cellar to last till the birdies nest again—and
I’m looking out for more.... Hey, waiter.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The waiter approached.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Call the steward. I want to talk to him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Presently the steward appeared.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Say,” began the millionaire who had summoned
him, “how much of this gin you got? Enough to
carry you through to May first?” May 1st, 1917,
was the date on which the state of Michigan became
an arid waste.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll have a surplus, sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How much?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The steward told him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Um!... What would that come to?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The steward figured a moment. “About seven
thousand dollars, sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll take it. Have it delivered—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Whoa there!” interrupted his companion.
“You’ll take half of it. I want the other half
myself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing doing. There ain’t enough to split....
But I’ll tell you what I’ll do. I’ll flop the dice
with you for it. Winner gets the gin, loser gets the
bill.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The other hammered the table with his palm.
“Fetch on your dice,” he said, boisterously.</p>

<p class='c004'>A box of dice was quickly set before them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Best two out of three?” asked Bob.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Naw.... Let’s have swift action. One flop.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right,” said Bob, rattling the cubes in their
box and spreading them on the table with practised
hand. “Beat that, my boy.” Three fives, an ace and
a four lay exposed. “My gin, I guess,” Bob crowed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not while the old man keeps his strength,” replied
his friend. “Just peel your eye and watch this.”
He made the cast. A pair of fours was the result.
“Oh, hell!” he said, not petulantly, not angrily, but
as if it were a duty. He pushed the dice back, and
the incident was closed; apparently he brushed it
from his mind as he had brushed back the ivory
cubes. “Say, I hear Bogel is going to reduce the
price of his car a hundred dollars....”</p>

<p class='c004'>In Detroit in that day men could hazard seven
thousand dollars on one cast of the dice without a
quickened throb of the pulse. To those two the winning
or losing of that sum was a trivial thing, a sort
of matching of pennies.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did you see that?” Potter asked of the major.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” said Major Craig, staring unbelievingly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, do you think our big men in Detroit are
going to interest themselves in anything so dinky
as a European war?... That’s the attitude of
mind that frightens me, Major. It’s here; it’s all
about us. A big, ingrowing selfishness; the ability
to squander and the will to squander.... Do you
think those men give a tinker’s dam about the
United States or what happens to it so long as their
ability to throw away thousands is left uninterfered
with?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Major Craig frowned, did not reply at once, but
presently said: “It’s Gargantuan; the thing is so
big that it almost wins itself dignity—this highflying
of your city. I’m not sure it’s so bad; it’s more like
boyishness.... There’s nothing mean about it;
it’s big, and its bigness bespeaks big men. It’s very
American. No other nation could produce it....
No, Mr. Waite, I don’t think this is the thing to
worry us. There’s something here, something tremendous,
something of marvelous vitality—like an
earthquake or Niagara. If it can be harnessed—put
to use.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter shook his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It will take a jar and a shock,” the major said,
“but I believe the day will come when America will
thank God for your spenders, your high-rollers—when
they wake up. There’s an openness, an open-handedness,
about them.... I believe they’re <em>men</em>....
I believe they will realize what their country
requires of them, and when they have come to realize
it, the whole world will stand amazed at the things
they do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Presently the major said: “I will make arrangements
for the test of your motor. It will have to be
sent on to us. I’ll write you where and when.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They went up to the major’s room, where they
talked more technicalities until a late hour. Potter
said good night, and with a feeling of warmth in his
soul, a feeling that these men really considered him
of value and that he was performing no mean service
for his country, he descended to the first floor. The
major’s parting words had been: “Stick to it, Mr.
Waite. Work over it, study it, keep on as you’ve
been going. You are doing a big thing, and your
country will owe you its thanks.”</p>

<p class='c004'>As he stepped out of the elevator he met Cantor,
just about to ascend. Cantor hesitated as if he considered
joining Potter, but Potter merely spoke and
passed on—not with any thought of brusqueness,
but because his mind was full, because he wanted
no companionship.</p>

<p class='c004'>Cantor stared after him. “What’s gotten hold of
him?” he asked himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sight of Cantor set in motion new thoughts
and speculations, thoughts that might grow into
suspicions. “The island was there,” Potter said
inwardly. “It was no dream. We fell there....”
The “we” ushered in Hildegarde von Essen. What
warmth of satisfaction he had been experiencing
was chilled. Black, brooding, morose shadows took
its place—a sort of mental nausea, a shuddering
horror of the fact she had stated to him.... Defiled!...
That unbelievable, dank, squalid fact!...
He saw her as the fairy prince of the day of
their flight. It did not seem that life would allow
such a glowing, buoyant, fire-pure thing to be touched
with evil. It was not a fact that would endure close
to her; it was a thing removed from her by an unsurpassable
gulf.... Yet it had leaped the gulf
and fallen upon her....</p>

<p class='c004'>She loved him; confessed that she loved him—confessed
this black thing to explain why she could
not marry him.... His brain burned; it seemed
as if he could not endure the reality of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Insidiously, unasked, came another fact. Cantor
had been her companion; there had been intimacy
between them.... Cantor was a man whom report
said to be without honor in his dealings with
women.... The thoughts had become suspicions,
searing suspicions. Never again could he take the
hand of Cantor in friendship unless they were cleared
away.... If Cantor were the man—But what
right had he to act? What was it to him? He found
himself hating Cantor with a lurid, blood-lusting
hatred. Yet he had only suspicions, vague suspicions....
Added to them was the question of
Cantor’s presence on that island and what it signified.
What was the man’s business? Who was the
man?... These were suspicions Cantor would have
labored much to have averted.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Now came months of labor and of scurrying
about the country for Potter Waite; half a
dozen trips to Washington interrupted his work in
the machine-shop; formalities, futile interviews, unreeling
of red tape wasted his time in the capital. It
seemed he could get nowhere, could lay his hand on
no definite information, perceive nowhere a definite
plan for the future or sign of constructing a plan.
If the Middle West was dozing, official Washington
appeared to him to be walking in its sleep.</p>

<p class='c004'>He had not seen Hildegarde, for her father had
once more sent her away, and she had not been reluctant
to go. If travel, fresh contacts, strange people
promised to distract her mind from the facts
she confronted, she would gladly give them an opportunity
to keep their promise. Her mind was a throbbing
carbuncle and any poultice was better than no
poultice. So she went east, then, with the opening
of the new year, she accompanied friends to Palm
Beach.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter studied his father as a sort of barometer of
the reactions of the conservative to world-events
growing daily more momentous. It was not a barometer
to register suddenly arising storm, Potter believed,
yet one morning he was awakened by his
father’s knuckles battering his door. Fabius did
not wait for Potter’s call to enter, but rushed into
the room, waving a newspaper.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Look at that!” he said, excitedly, hoarsely.
Potter had never before seen his father excited. Not
even the German note of late January announcing
a nation in the throes of rabies, revoking pledges,
declaring for unrestricted undersea savagery, had
overthrown his calm. Nor had Mr. Wilson’s action
in packing off von Bernstorff, ambassador and spy,
thrown him off his poise. But now he raged.</p>

<p class='c004'>“By God!” he exclaimed, “this means war, and
war <em>quick</em>! Read it!... Read it!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter read with stunned astonishment the story
of Zimmerman’s perfidy—of negotiations with Mexico
and Japan for a partition of America. Germany
purposed to make a second Poland of America
and with lavish generosity made present of three
great commonwealths to a country which was not a
government; a country not ruled by law and authority,
but given over to petty greeds and the
marauding bands of exalted bandits. What was
promised to Japan none might say—doubtless it was
equally lavish.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter said nothing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll wire the President,” Fabius Waite said, furiously.
“He can have my plant. I’ll quit making
automobiles if I can turn the whole thing to manufacturing
shells or guns.... We’ll need them;
we’ve got to have them.... Invade the United
States! March up the Mississippi Valley!...
We’ll show them, by George! where they’ll march!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dad,” said Potter, “you haven’t believed we
would be dragged into this war. Even when relations
were broken with Germany you still believed
with the great body of the people, that war was not
inevitable.... In your judgment, does this really
mean war?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If it doesn’t,” said Fabius, “then I quit the country
and take out citizen’s papers in Timbuctoo. If
we lay down under this the country isn’t fit to live
in.... You bet it means war.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter’s unspoken thought was, “Thank God for
Zimmerman.” Many other thoughtful men were
thanking God for Zimmerman that day, for as the
day grew older it became apparent that the alarm-clock
had done its work. The country was awake,
dazed but furious. And if one part of the country
might be said to be more furious than another, it
was the Middle West—for, a thing hitherto unbelievable—it
saw itself threatened by invasion.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then,” Potter said, “you’re willing to get your
shoulder behind the President?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“With every man and every machine and every
dollar,” said Fabius.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you want to help, Dad—if you want to
do the biggest thing there is to do—make aeroplanes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Eh?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You know what I’ve been doing. You know how
important the War Department realizes the aeroplane
to be.... And we’ve got to have thousands
of them.... The authorities are slow and they
muddle, but events will force them to do something....
No plant in the world can so quickly and
readily be converted to the manufacture of aeroplane
engines as yours.... And I believe I have
the motor....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Son, if the government backs what you say,
my plant is yours. Aeroplanes—we’ll show ’em how
to make aeroplanes.... You get busy. Find out
what they want. Get definite orders, and we’ll
take care of ’em if it costs me five million dollars to
do it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you feel like these fellows, Dad, who say
all we can do in this war, anyhow, is to dig up money
and manufacture munitions?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Fabius Waite struck his left palm with his right
fist.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” he said. “If we go in we go in. Don’t let
anybody fool you about that. We go in up to the
hilt. We fought Spain with a pop-gun. This time
Uncle Sam will go to war with a man’s-size six-shooter
in each hand and a knife in his boot. Getting into
this thing doesn’t mean sending an army to do the
fighting for us. It means sending the whole nation
to war.... Every one of us. We’ll have to mobilize
the biggest army we ever dreamed of, but we’ll
have to mobilize everything else, too—and until we
get used to this new thing there’s going to be the
devil to pay—the very devil to pay. There’ll be a
mess. Everybody will be running around in circles....
Just like expanding a ten-thousand-dollar
business overnight to take care of a million-dollar
order.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve got plans ready, Dad, for changing over
part of the plant to make my motor—if the government
adopts it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Get ’em out. Take it up with the engineers.
Go as far as you can, so that the moment the powers
in Washington press the button we’ll be ready.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve figured the cost of the change at about
half a million.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Whatever you need I’ll raise.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Guess I better run down to Washington.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good idea, and stick to ’em till you get something
definite.... You’re after an order. You’re
a salesman. Come back with something.”</p>

<p class='c004'>That night Potter took train for the capital. He
discovered on his way that the American people
had already declared war. They were outraged.
The formality of a declaration remained, but the
people had made up their minds. They saw what
they had to do, but did not realize the magnitude of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the club car was no other subject of conversation
but Zimmerman and his plottings. Throughout
the conversation ran a peculiar note of pity for the
German—for his intelligence, for the blindness of his
psychology.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was the one thing they could do,” an elderly
gentleman said, “to solidify the country. They
picked the way as if they were working for us....
And, by George! it was a darn fine piece of work on
somebody’s part to intercept that note!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter managed to get a room in the New Willard,
and, after going to his room for the refreshment of
a bath, he descended to the dining-room for luncheon.
He seated himself at a table and was looking over the
card when he heard a voice a table or so away. It
was a voice that made him lose interest in cards, in
food, in everything but the proximity of the owner
of the voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll have to guard everything,” it was saying.
“There won’t be a thing we can leave without watching....
I know.... These German spies and
German sympathizers.... Oh, I hate myself for
the German blood in my veins.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now, Hildegarde, that’s no way to talk. I’m
sure your father is as good a citizen as if his ancestors
had come over in the <em>Mayflower</em>—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Instead of the North German Lloyd,” Hildegarde
replied. “This talk of Mr. Wilson’s about
our having no quarrel with the German people is
<em>wrong</em>. It isn’t just the Kaiser. It’s the breed. We
want to forget that sort of nonsense. We’ll find
we’re fighting the German people—and what kind
we’re fighting. With their crucifixions and massacres
and abominations.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hildegarde!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, father knows what I think. And it’s true.
I’ve lived among them all my life. We used to think
they were merely crude, with bad manners....
It wasn’t that.... They’re savage. They never
even had a decent veneer of civilization.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said the lady with Hildegarde, “if all
German-Americans felt as you do—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m no German-American. There isn’t any such
thing. There are Americans and traitors. You can’t
sit on the fence.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter shoved back his chair and stood erect. In
his heart was a cramping pain; joy at seeing Hildegarde
found place beside reawakened torment....
He could not bear to turn to look at her, yet he could
not bear <em>not</em> to look at her. He clutched his chair
until his knuckles showed white.... She was not
to be resisted. He shoved the chair away and strode
to her table.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hildegarde!” he said. It was a cry wrung from
him as a cry is wrung from a tree in the forest when
some mighty tempest twists and rends it, splitting it,
tearing into white wound the fibers that surround its
heart.</p>

<p class='c004'>She looked up, drew back, uttered a little cry.
For a moment she was silencing herself, saying to
herself: “I must be calm. I must keep a hold on
myself.... I can’t have a scene here.” Then she
arose, smiled brightly a spurious smile, and extended
her hand. “Why, Mr. Waite, this is such a surprise!”
She turned to her companion. “This is
Mr. Waite, from Detroit, Mrs. Roscombe. Mrs.
Roscombe and I have worked up here by degrees
from Palm Beach. Our last stop was Pinehurst. Such
golfing! You’ve been to Pinehurst, of course.” She
was talking rapidly, saying anything that came into
her head until she could gain full possession of herself.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Roscombe stared, then gave Potter her hand.
“Of the Waite Motor Company?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>He nodded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What brings you here?” Hildegarde said, fearing
a pause. “Oh, to be sure! I know. It’s your motor,
isn’t it? How is it getting along? Sit down and tell
us all about it.... You haven’t lunched, have
you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” he said, tonelessly, wondering how she
could seem so happy, be so trivial, with that black
thing crouching behind her. He was young....</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sit down, then, and tell me all about Detroit—and
everybody. Who’s married whom?...”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I haven’t seen you for months,” he said, baldly,
and Mrs. Roscombe smiled faintly. She had perceived
something of the tenseness of the moment and
had wondered at it. Now she fancied she knew. She
imagined some lover’s misunderstanding, and, dowager-like,
saw herself in the beneficent rôle of peace-maker
and match-maker. Why not? The son of the
Waite Motor Company was a catch worth angling for.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do sit down, Mr. Waite,” she said, and motioned
to a chair.</p>

<p class='c004'>He complied stiffly, like a man functioning in his
sleep.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You—you look just the same,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You didn’t expect me to age a great deal in four
months, did you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He was not thinking of age. He was thinking of
that other thing, wondering how she could retain that
air of boyishness, that outward semblance of joyous
virginity? He was astonished that she bore no mark,
no scarlet letter.... To him she was lovely, glowing—the
slender, daring, boyish-pure fairy prince of
his dreams.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s going to be war, isn’t there?” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Shall you enlist?... I suppose you can have a
commission for the asking.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I sha’n’t enlist. I wish I could.... But I’ve
work to do here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Enlisting was a new thought, but an attractive
one. He wished his duty did not lay where it
was; that he might go to France and be a part of that
Gehenna where, he thought, no man might remember.
If a tenth of the stories of battle were true,
then a man might find forgetfulness on the field
of carnage.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your motor, of course. Tell me about it. You
know I—I am interested.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s nothing to tell.... I’m waiting.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The waiter intervened and their orders were given.
Hildegarde kept up a persistent glitter of talk, leaping
from topic to topic, flushed, almost panting in
her eagerness to avoid the silent moment. Mrs.
Roscombe eyed her quizzically and thought that very
little of her skill as a match-maker was necessary here.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We are going driving this afternoon,” she said.
“Perhaps Mr. Waite would enjoy a ride about
Washington.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I—” Potter stopped and looked at Hildegarde.
He had no engagement for the afternoon. Not before
evening could he see Major Craig, and it might
be days before he could manage interviews with the
dignitaries who held the fate of his motor in their
hands. He wanted to go, wanted to be near her, to
hear her voice—to continue to be compelled by her
eyes and her manner, by all herself, to disbelieve the
frightful thing she had confessed. He could not look
at her and believe.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do come,” she said, affrightedly.</p>

<p class='c004'>They finished their luncheon. “The car will be
at the door at two,” said Mrs. Roscombe. “It’s
nearly that now. We’ll just run up for our wraps.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They disappeared and Potter waited. Presently
Hildegarde appeared.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mrs. Roscombe said to get in the car. She’ll be
down in a jiffy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They waited several jiffies and she did not come.
Then a page stepped to the door of the car and
extended a note.</p>

<p class='c004'>“For Miss von Essen,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hildegarde opened it, frowned, bit her lip, for she
saw through the stratagem. “Mrs. Roscombe says
she’s detained. Some one just ’phoned her, and she
must stay to meet them. We’re to go on just the
same.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter was glad, yet he was frightened. He wanted
to be alone with Hildegarde, yet he was terrified at
being alone with her. Her sensations were akin to
his own. She wanted to be with him, to feel him
near her again. Her love for him had not abated, yet
now it seemed to flame up to a life it had never before
known. It was as if he had been restored to her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m—glad,” he said, slowly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So am I,” she said, breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c004'>The car started, but where it went or how it went
neither of them cared. For minutes they sat silent,
each drinking in the knowledge of the other’s presence.
It was a heady beverage.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hildegarde ...” he began, presently.</p>

<p class='c004'>She turned her eyes upon him. His face was an
accusation; there was yearning there, grief, something
else that she could not define, but it hurt her
worst of all.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You told me you loved me,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t ...” she cried.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You told me you loved me,” he repeated, harshly.
“Was it true?”</p>

<p class='c004'>She would not answer, would not look at him now,
but drew away from him fearfully. He took her
hand, not gently, and drew her toward him. “Look
at me,” he commanded. “I want to see your eyes....
When I see your eyes I—” He was going to say
he could not believe, but stopped himself. It would
be turning the knife around in her wound....
“Were you telling the truth?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was true,” she said, faintly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you love me now?”</p>

<p class='c004'>She tried to take away her hand, but he held it
fiercely, bent fiercely toward her. “I don’t love you,”
he said, breathlessly. “It’s something more than
that.... I can’t tell you what it is, how it feels....
I’ve got to have you. I don’t care what has
happened. I don’t care about anything.... You
must marry me. Nothing matters but that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She was white, felt as if she were stifling. “Let
go,” she said, piteously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you love me?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I— No!... No!... Stop the car and let
me out! Oh, leave me alone! You’re torturing me!”</p>

<p class='c004'>He was flaming. His restraint was gone and he
was but the starving lover fighting a battle to the
death for his love.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing matters,” he repeated. “I don’t care....
Do you love me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He drew her closer, careless what eyes might peer
through the windows of the limousine. His arm
was about her shoulders, her lithe body was strained
against his body, and his face was close to hers. She
closed her eyes. She did not feel faint, but deliciously
helpless. She did not care.... This was
the thing she had been waiting for, crying for ...
this thing that was forbidden to her. She did not
struggle. He kissed her lips again and again, muttering
incoherently. She returned his kisses....</p>

<p class='c004'>Presently she tried to release herself. “We’re in
the—street,” she panted. “People can see.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let them see.” It was his old recklessness.
“What do we care?... Tell me now. You love
me? I want to hear you say it. Say it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I love you,” she said, softly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you’ll marry me? Say that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She pushed him away and the life and youth died
out of her eyes. Instead of Potter by her side she
saw her father; saw him convicted of treason, a
thing to be spat upon and reviled.... Her father!...
This moment had been sweet—but other moments
were impossible, a life of them was hideously
impossible. Hers was a blood and heritage she could
take to no man. No man’s life should mingle with
her life to produce a child who should call his grandfather
traitor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No!...” she cried, wildly. “You mustn’t ask.
I can marry no man. I can never marry.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hildegarde,” he said, his voice tense, vibrant,
“listen. I don’t care. You—told me before....
It doesn’t matter. It’s as if nothing had ever happened....
I want you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can’t marry you,” she said. She clenched herself
in a vise-grip of determination, became calmer.
She must, she knew, convince Potter of her determination;
must convince him that nothing could
change her. “Potter, I’d die before I would marry
you. You must believe me. It cannot be....
You’re cruel to ask me.... Please, oh, please!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hildegarde!”</p>

<p class='c004'>She shook her head. “Nothing can change me.
See. Look into my eyes if you think you can make
me change.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He looked into her eyes long, beseechingly, then
turned away his face. He had seen. Her will was
glowing there, unconquerable. He was answered,
answered finally.</p>

<p class='c004'>Minutes after he turned to her again. “I saw,”
he said. “But will you tell me this?... I’ve got
to know. Who was it? Was Cantor—”</p>

<p class='c004'>She started. “Cantor?” What did he know about
Cantor? Had he discovered something about the
man that she herself had been unable to discover?
Had he definitely placed Cantor as a German spy,
a master of spies?... If so, he must know about
her father, too. “Cantor?” she repeated. “What
do you know about Mr. Cantor?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing. But I must know. Was it he?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can tell you nothing about him,” she said.
“But I can warn you. Don’t trust him. If you have
anything you value, keep it out of his hands. Don’t
let him near your motor.... Keep him away from
you.... Don’t trust that man.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He bowed his head. “You’ve answered me,” he
said, in a stifled voice.... So it was Cantor. The
man to whom he owed this agony was Cantor....
He ground his teeth. Then he grew gentle with her.
“Remember, Hildegarde, that I love you. It isn’t
a little love that would be afraid of anything. Nothing
would matter to it. Will you remember that, and
if ever you change—if anything changes you—will
you know that I’m waiting for you?” He lifted her
hand and kissed it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let me out, please,” he said. “I—I can’t stay
near you.... It’s too much for me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good-by, Potter,” she said, softly. “I— Oh,
how I wish I might come to you!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The car stopped and Potter alighted. He stood
on the curb, looking after Hildegarde, until the car
turned a corner and disappeared.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Cantor,” he said to himself, and whispered the
name over and over. “Cantor.... Cantor....
Cantor....” Could Mr. Cantor have sensed the
furnace that raged in Potter’s brain it might have
caused him certain uneasiness.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter walked and walked until he regained some
semblance of calmness. Then he turned his footsteps
toward the hotel. In the corridor he met numerous
men in uniform and vaguely envied them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They’re going,” he said. “It’s luck.... Maybe
the biggest luck would be to go—and not come back.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>It was July before Potter Waite saw Detroit
again for more than a few hours. His business
lay in Washington, and in Washington he remained.
It was his privilege to hear from the gallery the most
momentous utterance ever to issue from the New
World when Mr. Wilson guided this country down
into the abyss of war. Later he met on equal terms
with the great automobile minds of the country
when they were called together to give to their flag
the dearly bought knowledge of motor construction
which was their most precious possession. He saw
his own motor placed before him, and waited in a
sort of white glow of eagerness for what would be
the outcome of that herculean labor performed by
two men called to give to America the motor needed
for her mighty air fleets. That moment when he
saw his year’s work had not been in vain was one of
the splendid moments of his life, for his motor had
been the basis upon which those engineers had
worked, and from it they developed the perfect thing.</p>

<p class='c004'>In July he came home, not empty-handed. The
honor of receiving the first contract had been awarded
to the Waite Motor Company and Potter carried it,
a sacred treasure, buttoned against his breast.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then began in earnest the conversion of an enormous
wing of the Waite Motor Company’s plant
to the production of that wonderful and delicate
mechanism which was to drive America through the
air to victory. It began in secrecy and silence. The
part of the plant undergoing the change might have
vanished from the world, for all the news that issued
from it. It was guarded as the vaults of the national
Treasury are not guarded, by a little army of government
men trained in the arts of vigilance.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But,” said the chief of them to Potter, “we can
work with a sweet confidence that Germany has her
men inside. We’ve investigated every employee to
his birth—we think—but I’ll bet my hat more than
one spy is planted there.... So we trust nobody....
There are German spies and then there are
German spies.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter looked a question.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said the chief, “there’s the ordinary spy
that the country’s full of. I can catch you one in
half an hour if you want him.... And there are
the spies who do the real work—and I’d give a year
of my life for every one of them I could lay hands
on.... The garden variety of spy is a comic-supplement
fellow. Tell you how to spot him. Go
and stand in a hotel lobby and read a letter. If you
feel somebody breathing on the back of your neck,
turn around and grab—and you’ve got your man.
It’s part of the technique—to breathe on the back of
your neck. They’re drilled in it like the army is in
the goose step. The German is constructed by nature
to be obvious. If he’s a spy he acts like a spy—as
he conceives a spy to be.... There was the fellow
we caught trying to blow up a mighty important
railroad bridge. Lieutenant in the navy. He disguised
himself as a bum; let his beard grow and
rubbed grime on his hands. Then he took him his
little bomb in a suit-case and went out to do his day’s
work. Now did he ride to that railroad bridge on a
freight, or back in a day coach on a slow train? Not
him! He bought a section on the Millionaires’ Special—six
days’ beard and all. Of course we spotted him,
and I asked him why the devil he boarded that sort
of train in such a get-up. He looked me over supercilious
and says, says he: ‘I’m a gentleman. You
couldn’t expect me to ride second class.’”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter laughed. “They’re not all like that,
though,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You bet they aren’t,” said the chief, with compressed
lips. “You had some experience, didn’t
you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They tried to blow up the shop,” Potter said,
briefly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ve got to act as if we knew they were going
to try to blow up <em>this</em> shop.... Your German-Americans
in Detroit have been pretty well-behaved.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” said Potter. “There was any quantity of
talk before April sixth. I imagine they’ve quieted
down now. Personally I’ve thought it was just talk
and a natural sympathy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ninety per cent. of the Germans in this country
wish we would hang the other ten per cent. so they
could live in peace. But we can’t forget the other
ten per cent. They’re bad, and they mean business.
It’s hard to make folks believe it, though. Somehow
Americans don’t take spies and that sort of thing
seriously. It looks sometimes as if they didn’t take
war seriously.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” said Potter. “There wasn’t any big wave
of excitement when war was declared. The people
took it complacently. They don’t realize.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They won’t realize until some morning’s paper is
full of lists of the dead.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Out here we have a sort of attitude that seems
to say, ‘Well, we’ve gone to war, but we aren’t going
to get hurt.’”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It isn’t my job to wake them up. I’ll be busy
keeping information from getting <em>out</em> of this place—and
gentlemen with bombs from getting in.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And my job,” said Potter, gravely, “is to make
motors.... To make motors quickly,” he said, his
voice coming to life, his eyes awakening to a glow
of enthusiasm. “It’s a fine job—the best job in the
world. Some day the air of France will be dark
with American ’planes, and I’ll have helped. I can
almost see it—hundreds and thousands of aeroplanes
with their noses pointed toward Berlin, and nothing
on God’s footstool to stop them. Enough of them to
drive the German out of the air and keep him out....
And then we’ll play with him from the air....
A barrage of American aeroplanes behind the
German lines—imagine that!—cutting them off,
smashing their communications! All we’ve got to
have is <em>enough</em>—and the war’s over.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Secret Service man looked at Potter quietly.
“You’re not taking this war so placidly,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter did not smile. “It will come,” he said.
“Gradually we’re finding out we have a country—and
that we love our country. Wait till you see this
American people awake and on the job. I don’t
take it placidly, because the thing was shoved down
my throat. I was kicked awake.” He turned away
and went into the office that he occupied now more
often twelve hours a day than eight. Here he remained
until noon in constant conference with railroad
man, engineer, steel representative, or machinery
man come to explain delay in delivery or to
promise beyond possibility of performance. At noon
he drove down-town to the club for lunch.</p>

<p class='c004'>As he entered the building he saw young Matthews,
a frail-bodied millionaire whose hobby was mechanics,
gesticulating in the center of an interested group.</p>

<p class='c004'>Will Kraemer saw Potter and beckoned to him.
“Something new,” he said. “The aeroplane joyrider
has come.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hey, Matthews, tell it to Waite!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Matthews was more than willing. He was angry,
excited, but pleased to be commanding so much
attention. “Somebody swiped my hydro,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“At last Matthews has won a first,” laughed
Eldredge. “First aeroplane to be stolen in America.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the joke?” Potter wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No joke.... You wouldn’t think it was a joke
if you saw my man Mullens. Somebody hit him on
the nose with a sledgehammer. Found him tied up
in a bundle and dumped in a corner, and blood all
over the shop.... This morning. Went down
about nine o’clock to sort of look at things. Door
was locked. I thought Mullens was off on a bat,
and then when I looked inside and saw the machine
was gone, I thought he’d gone crazy. He couldn’t
fly a kite.... Machine clean gone. Then I heard
a miawing in one of the lockers, and there was
Mullens, all in, with enough waste stuffed in his
mouth to choke an elephant. I yanked him out
and turned him loose and asked him what was the
answer. He said he was reading the paper about
ten last night and somebody hammered on the door.
Mullens opened it, and before he could sniff the air
he got that wallop on the nose. Next he knew a
couple of boys were sitting on him and stuffing
waste in his mouth. They stuffed him in the locker-room
and shut the door, and then in a couple of
hours he heard them run the machine out, start
the motor, and breeze off.... And that’s all. Just
clean vanished, going straight up, as near as I can
find out. Nobody seems to have seen them or heard
them. Not a darn trace.... Now wouldn’t that
get you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is this real stuff, Matthews? You aren’t planting
any sort of joke?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s so dam real that I’ll pay a little reward of
five thousand bucks to the boy that brings the
machine back again,” Matthews said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hard luck,” said Potter. “But why the devil
should anybody steal an aeroplane? A white elephant
would be as easy to hide, and they couldn’t
sell it. Get pinched the minute they tried that. I
don’t get the idea.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Didn’t somebody steal a jail once?” Eldredge
asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did they leave anything behind?” Potter asked,
“anything for the police to smell of and run off on
the trail?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We haven’t found a burnt match that Mullens
couldn’t account for. It was a clean job. They just
appeared—and then—” He whistled and waved his
hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do the police have to offer?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Matthews looked disgusted. “I don’t think they
believe I ever had an aeroplane,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If ’planes get as common as automobiles,” said
O’Mera, who had strolled up, “the police will have
to have a flying squadron of Zeppelins outfitted with
enormous butterfly-nets. Some game that, eh?
Chasing a stolen aeroplane a few thousand feet above
ground and snaffling it in a bug-net.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You fellows are joshing me,” Matthews complained.
“You wouldn’t be so darn funny if somebody
had run off with twenty thousand dollars of
yours.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe the Kaiser’s army of German reservists
who were going to seize the country have grabbed it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You fellows make me sick,” Matthews said,
walking away in disgust, followed by a laugh.</p>

<p class='c004'>But Potter did not laugh; the thing was too bizarre,
too weighted with sinister possibilities. It
was absurd to suppose the enemies of the country had
stolen that lone aeroplane, and yet what a weapon
an aeroplane would be in their hands!</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you think?” Kraemer asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter shook his head. “It’s past me. But I
don’t like it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They walked up-stairs together to the dining-room,
discussing the thing. At the table Kraemer
suddenly changed the subject.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Potter,” he said, “I want to get into the second
officers’ training-camp. It’ll be starting sometime
in a month or so.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fine!... Wish I could go, too.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Kraemer hesitated. “I’m afraid,” he said, “they
won’t take me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, our name is German—and Dad was born
in Germany.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter looked at the table-cloth. “How does your
father feel about it?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dad’s an American, Potter. You never heard
any of this pro-German guff out of him.... The
suggestion came from him. He says this is where
Americans with German parentage have to fish or
cut bait. It’s his notion that we fellows have got to
do more than the rest of you with unimpeachable
American antecedents. ‘We’ve got to do our duty,’
Dad says, ‘and then we’ve got to double that.’”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wish they were all like him,” Potter said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I want to go—worse than I’ve ever wanted anything....
Watts is gone and so are La Mothe and
Randall. Three of the old crowd.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If there’s anything I can do—or father can do—”
Potter said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s damn hard for a fellow to have to prove he’s
not a traitor.... How would you feel?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe I can help.... Training-camps for
aviators are being opened up. I think I can give
you a fair start there. How would you like that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Kraemer’s eyes glowed. “Potter,” he said, “if
you can get me past I’ll—give you my right arm
when the country gets through using it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A club attendant approached the table. “A man
named Givens is asking to see you, sir.... Says he
works for you, and it’s important, sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Tell him I’ll be right down,” Potter said. Then
to Kraemer, “I’ll get the papers from the Signal
Corps for you so you can apply for admission. Let
you know as soon as they show up.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Standing awkwardly just inside the entrance, uneasy
in surroundings of luxury and manifestly apprehensive
of club servants in livery, stood a young
man with a knee quite torn from his trousers, with a
hat that would never again be fit for service, with a
face that appeared to have come into contact with
emery-paper, and with a general accumulation of
dirt on his clothes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, Givens,” said Potter, “what’s wrong?
Are you hurt?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, sir,” said Givens, “not hurt to speak of, but
shook up. I—I knew you would be here, Mr.
Waite, so I busted right in. I thought you ought to
know right off.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” said Potter, impatiently.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m one of the office messengers,” Givens said.
“We use motor-cycles—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know who you are. What has happened?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I was to stop at twelve o’clock to get a package
of drawin’s or somethin’ from Hammond and
Green, the engineers. I got them all right, and
started for the plant. Went up Woodward to the
Boulevard and across. You know where the Boulevard
goes under the railroad? Well, right there a
machine came up behind me and bumped me. I
went down pretty hard. Sort of knocked out for a
minute. When I scrambled up I looked all over for
that package, but I couldn’t find it any place. It
couldn’t have fell anywhere out of sight, for I was
right under the railroad. There wasn’t any sewer
openin’s or anythin’.... Somebody must ’a’ swiped
it. I hunted good, and then I come down here as
fast as I could. The motor-cycle wasn’t hurt
any.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What was in the package? What drawings?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know, sir.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter called an attendant. “Show this man the
wash-room and help him brush up,” he said. Then
he stepped quickly into a telephone-booth and called
the plant.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mr. Withers,” he said to the switchboard-operator,
and presently the chief of the Waite mechanical
engineers answered the telephone.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This is Potter Waite. What drawings were you
getting from Hammond and Green this noon?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A set of blue prints of Buildings G and F.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A complete set?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, showing machinery placed, shafting, conveyers—everything.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thank you,” said Potter, and hung up the receiver.</p>

<p class='c004'>Givens was waiting, a trifle more presentable.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’re sure there’s no chance you overlooked
the package anywhere?” Potter asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, sir. I think it was a plant, Mr. Waite, that’s
what. I think them men in that machine knocked
me over apurpose to swipe them drawin’s.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m inclined to agree with you. Better go home
and get fixed up. Need a new suit, won’t you? Buy
it and give the bill to me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thank you, Mr. Waite,” Givens said, and limped
away.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter drove at once to the office. As he entered
he met Downs, the Secret Service man, coming down
the stairs.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come up to the office, please,” Potter said.
“Something in your line, I guess.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter closed the door and motioned to a chair.
“A messenger bringing drawings of the buildings
we’re changing over was knocked down on his way
out this noon, and the blue prints taken away from
him.” He gave the incident to Downs as Givens
had given it to him. “By the way,” he added, “a
mighty strange thing happened last night. An aeroplane
was stolen.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Saw it in the paper,” said Downs.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve been wondering,” Potter said, “if there was
any connection between the two thefts. Seems far-fetched,
but these are far-fetched days. Who would
steal an aeroplane, and what in thunder would he
steal it for?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“An aeroplane is a mighty useful toy,” said
Downs.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A mighty conspicuous toy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m not so sure. Easy to hide in some out-of-the-way
place. That machine worries me more than
the loss of those blue prints. That’s a sort of warning
we ought to be thankful for, though it doesn’t
tell us much we didn’t feel pretty sure of. We’re
working on the certainty that they’ll try to interfere
with this plant, and they’ve verified it for us....
But that aeroplane.... We can watch the employees,
and we can do a pretty good job of guarding
the plant on the ground, but how in thunder, Mr.
Waite, are we going to stop anybody from flying
over the top of it some night and dropping a ton or
so of explosive on the roof? There’s a German with
something pretty close to genius running things
hereabouts.... You’ve probably eaten dinner with
him,” Downs said, with a chuckle.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Eh? You mean you suspect some one?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I mean that I don’t, worse luck. What I mean
is that the fellow who ought to be suspected is probably
above suspicion. He’s somebody you know well
and meet every day. The kind of man who would
have the enterprise to think of stealing an aeroplane
is mighty apt to be the man you invite to
dinner.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll have me suspecting everybody I know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“While you are making motors for the Signal
Corps,” said Downs, soberly, “that’s exactly what
you <em>must</em> do. So far as your work is concerned, treat
every living soul as if you knew he was a German
spy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It seems as if a thing as big as a hydro-aeroplane
ought to be found,” Potter said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s got to be found,” said Downs. “Not only
for the protection of the industrial plants in Detroit,
but think of the danger it throws over the ship-canal
at the Flats and the channel into Lake Erie. They
could even work east as far as the Welland. An aeroplane
and a few tons of explosive could come pretty
close to bottling up the commerce of the Lakes, Mr.
Waite.... And I’ve a notion that’s the big game....
Our ore comes down the Lakes. Stop the ore
and you stop the steel-mills. Then what?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I guess,” said Potter, slowly, “that we’re really
in the war at last.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The country will wake up some morning to a
dazing realization of it,” Downs said, as one states
a fact which he dreads but knows to be inevitable.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Hildegarde von Essen returned reluctantly
to Detroit late in June, some two weeks
before Potter Waite, his work in Washington having
borne fruit and the fruit been harvested, came to
put in motion the gigantic new industry which was
to mean so much to his city—and to the whole world.
Hildegarde came home with dragging steps and
black forebodings. For months she had tried to
forget Detroit, forget her father, put from her mind
that searing knowledge of her father’s infamy. She
had succeeded but poorly. People at Palm Beach
had found her eccentric—flighty they had called her.
She had been flighty. There was no absurdity she
would not attempt in her demand for excitement
and restlessness; she caused talk; she attracted few—even
of the younger men, for, somehow, they felt
uncomfortable in her presence. She was never still,
demanded action always, and cared little how outrageous
to convention that action might be. And
she was changeable. In an instant, without perceptible
cause, she would descend from reckless deviltry
to somber moroseness. Even her beauty, her compelling
magnetism, her known wealth, did not suffice
to hold admirers. One young man announced
his firm belief that she was a trifle balmy, and that,
if she weren’t, he’d be hanged if her gait wasn’t too
tricky for him to harness up to her. It was the
general opinion. The same opinion prevailed later
at Pinehurst, at Old Point, in Washington. Who was
there to guess that a young girl was ridden by such
an Old Man of the Sea?</p>

<p class='c004'>Her father forbade her to come home without his
permission, and she had not intended to come home
until that meeting with Potter Waite in Washington
had made Detroit a magnet with a power she could
not resist, no matter how much she dug in her little
heels and hung back.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. . She must be near him;
must be where she could see him, feel his existence.
He called to her in his vexed heart and the call was
carried to her own heart.... So she went home.</p>

<p class='c004'>She arrived without warning, and the arrival of
her taxicab at her father’s door was the first indication
that household had of her coming. The servant
who opened the door did not know her; he had appeared
during her absence. Other servants were new,
and the whole aspect of the house had changed.
She did not like it. It held a promise of something
not allaying to her terrors. The very air of the house
was heavy. As she went up to her room she heard
the strange manservant telephone her father, “Your
daughter has arrived,” and presently he rapped on
her door and said, obsequiously, “It is your father’s
wish that you do not leave the house until he arrives.”
She had a feeling of being surrounded,
watched, shut off from communication with the
world.</p>

<p class='c004'>She went to the telephone herself with intention
to speak to some one, some one outside that house,
some friend, she cared little whom, but the servant,
still obsequious, intervened. “Your father directed,
Miss von Essen, that you were not to make use of
the telephone.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She turned without a word and retired to her
room. In half an hour Herman von Essen came
heavily up the stairs and rapped ungently on her
door. He did not wait for her summons to enter,
but thrust the door open and confronted her, purple
with fury, roaring the instant his eyes beheld her:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who told you to come home?... What are
you doing here?... I ordered you to stay away
with your meddling and spying. How dare you
come back without my permission?” He plunged
toward her, with gross hands hungering to lay themselves
upon her with savage violence.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t touch me,” she said, her voice brittle and
cold like arctic ice. “Don’t dare touch me....
I swore on the Bible, but if you touch me, if you
ever touch me with so much as the tip of your finger,
I’ll forget it.... I can hang you,” she said, and it
seemed to him her eyes leaped into sudden savagery,
“and if you drive me too far I’ll do it.... I’ll
forget what it means to me—the disgrace and horror
of it; I’ll forget you’re my father. <em>Be careful!</em>”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You would? You would, eh, you cat?... I’ll
show you. I’ll cage you.” He was beside himself
with anger, yet he was afraid. She saw it and despised
him the more.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you kept your promise?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Promise? What promise? What business is it
of yours what I’ve done?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is my business. It was a bargain. Have you
kept it? Have you kept clear of these spies? Have
you thrown them out of the house? Have you
stopped your fires and your explosions and your
murders?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>She stared into his eyes a moment. “I don’t
believe you,” she said; “I don’t believe you intended
to.” He snarled at her incoherently. “My country
is at war,” she said, passionately, “and men like
you have forced her into war—you spies and traitors
and murderers—your race of murderers. Are you
playing fair with me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” he said. “The war—I’m through with
them. I’m an American citizen.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you hadn’t said that I might have believed
you. I know what sort of American citizen you are!...
You lied to me and got me out of the way....
What’s a lie more or less among Germans?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I lied, did I? I’ll show you how I lied.” He
was insane with passion. “I <em>did</em> lie.... Did you,
a squalling cat of a girl, think you could interfere?
This damned country—a cat’s-paw for England....
I’m a German—a German, do you hear? And
you’re a German.... We fight for the fatherland....
They think to make war! They think to crush
the fatherland!... We’re teaching them a lesson.
When the day is come—when the call goes out—then
I won’t be a German in America, I’ll be a German
in Germany!...” He stopped, his face the
color of some unspeakable jungle orchid nourished
by steaming, poisonous vapors. He had said too
much; his rage had betrayed his tongue, and he
looked at her with narrowed, calculating eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can ’tend to you,” he said, softly. “I’ll cage
you. I’ll keep your mouth shut.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’re—my—father,” she said, slowly, incredulously.
It was ghastly, woven of nightmare threads,
that this man, whose very physical presence had become
revolting, should be one of the authors of her
existence. She owed life to him. How gladly would
she have blotted out the years to her birth and waned
into nothingness, non-existence!</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m your father,” he repeated after her. “See
you remember it.... You’ve come back where
you weren’t wanted; now you’ll stay where you don’t
want to stay.... I’ve got my hands on you and
I’ll keep them there.... You little fool! There’s
no danger in you.” He laughed grossly. “I’ll
quarantine you. You’ve caught a secret that’s contagious,
and I’ll quarantine you. You sha’n’t leave
this house; you sha’n’t see anybody or talk to anybody.
I’m not giving you orders. You’ll be watched
day and night.... If you think you can get out—try
it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Get out of my room!” she cried, and, rushing
past him, she threw open the door. She stood
crouching, tigerish, and he drew away from her as
he passed. In the hall he shook his fist at her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Try to get out!” he bellowed. “Try to send a
word out of this house!”</p>

<p class='c004'>She slammed the door, slammed it with all her
strength, and locked it. Her one thought was to
injure her father—to hurt him physically. She
wanted to see him suffering, crying out in agony....
Wild plans for bringing retribution down on
his head flashed through her brain.... She could
set the house on fire. She could do this or do that....
It was wild, unreasoning rage.</p>

<p class='c004'>After a time she heard a sound at her door long
continued. She snatched it open and found the
strange serving-man there on his knees, a basket of
tools at his side</p>

<p class='c004'>“What are you doing?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your father’s orders, Miss. I’m putting a lock
on this door.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“To lock me in?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can’t say, Miss.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What else would it be for?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know, Miss.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you a German spy, too?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I? Oh no, Miss. No, indeed, Miss.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wait....” She ran to her dressing-bag and
found her well-filled purse. “I need a friend in this
house—and I can afford to pay for one. Will you
mail a letter for me? Here’s fifty dollars.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fifty dollars?... Is that all you’ve got, Miss?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve got two hundred,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Give it to me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She thought he was hers and placed the money
in his hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is this all? Are you sure this is all you’ve got?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Every penny.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very well, Miss. I shall hand it to your father.
It might be, Miss, that you’d find somebody you
could bribe.... Now, Miss, if you’ll go into your
room I’ll finish my work.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was something grim, something quiet and
determined, about the man. She was afraid of him,
for he seemed not so much a man as an automaton,
not controlled by human emotions. She made no
protest, but re-entered her room and the door closed
after her. Presently sounds of work ceased and she
tried the door. It was secured from the outside;
she was a prisoner.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her first impulse was to rush to the window from
which she had once made her escape to meet Potter
Waite. She peered out. Below was a man with a
rake in his hand, ostensibly a gardener, but he was
quick to see her in the window. Without a smile he
tipped his hat—and drew a step closer.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hours later a rap came on her door.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is it?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your dinner, Miss.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Take it away,” she said. She would not eat. She
would starve herself—starve herself to death. She
could do that—and then there would have to be
explanations. The body of a young woman starved
to death would be something to arouse unpleasant
curiosity. Well, she would provide the body....
But she became calmer. Life was not alluring, but
what good could her death bring? Besides, she was
helpless, and there were ways of forcing one to eat....
She considered the indignity of it, of being tied
down by servants and forcibly fed.... No, when
breakfast came she would eat....</p>

<p class='c004'>Later she undressed and went to bed, but she
could not sleep. She could not endure that silent
darkness, so she got up and put on a gown and
crouched in the corner of her window-seat. Outside
she could see the black figure of a man pacing up
and down....</p>

<p class='c004'>She was cooler now, almost calm—with the numb
calmness of despair. She was a chip caught in the
undertow of monstrous events, drawn under, carried
into awful depths. She could see no future. For her
life was at an end; she could not look past to-morrow.
The undertow had drawn her down into the deep
places of an ocean of horrors which submerged the
earth, and she could never hope again to reach the
surface.... She was not frightened, she was horrified
and hopeless—and very lonely.... She
moved across the room to her dressing-table and took
in her hands her mother’s picture, peering into that
calm, dignified face, into those remembered eyes, and
striving with frantic eagerness to read some message
there.... There was no message.</p>

<p class='c004'>Once more she crouched on the window-seat and
propped the photograph on her knees—and there
she fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c004'>She did not deny her breakfast in the morning,
nor did she refuse to eat at noon.... Somehow
she did not think about escape, did not care to escape.
She was better there, shut away from the world. It
was peace of a kind. If she escaped, what would
she do with liberty? She did not know. But one
thing she did know—she would not inform upon her
father. She could not. No hatred, no love of country,
could force her to do that thing and bring down
upon herself that indelible disgrace—to be looked
at with sidewise glances, to be pointed at all the remaining
days of her life as the daughter of a spy, a
traitor....</p>

<p class='c004'>It was mid-afternoon when the knock of the serving-man
aroused her. She knew his knock already,
for there was something stealthy, furtive about it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A gentleman to see you, Miss.” She heard him
unlocking the outer fastenings of the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who is it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I was not told to say, Miss. You will find the
gentleman in the library.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What if I refuse to go down?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I should advise against that, Miss.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She had a vision of herself carried down, kicking,
struggling, to be pitched unceremoniously into some
man’s presence. It was unendurable.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Say I will be down in a moment,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thank you, Miss.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was not her father, of course, but who could it
be who was allowed to see her? She could not imagine,
and speculations were futile. In five minutes
she was descending the stairs. At the front door
stood the new servant, his eyes upon her respectfully.
There obviously was to be no chance to avoid the
library for an attempt at the out-of-doors. She
walked to the library door and stepped inside. Cantor
arose and stepped toward her eagerly, hand extended,
his winning smile lighting his face.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Welcome home,” he said. “I can’t tell you how
I’ve missed you all these months.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How do you do, Mr. Cantor?” she said, unsmiling
and somehow unsurprised. She had not expected
to see him, yet that it should be he was not astonishing.
Indeed, thought she, who else could it have
been if—if the thing she had vague reasons for
suspecting of this man were true?</p>

<p class='c004'>“I called on your father this morning,” he said.
“He told me you were at home—that you had run
in and surprised him. I asked if he thought you
would be receiving so soon, and he was so good as
to reassure me. I hope I’m not intruding?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” she said. “Won’t you sit down?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thank you. Shall we sit by the window here?”
He looked at her and laughed. “Your father seemed
to be in a temper.... Actually he was peevish at
you. I really don’t think he liked the idea of my
coming to call, but I smoothed him down splendidly.
He thawed and admitted that you and he had been
having a little disagreement.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did he tell you what the disagreement was?”
she said, directly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, indeed,” said Cantor, with lifted brows,
“but I gather he was really angry with you. Said
something about shutting you up and that sort of
nonsense out of the Victorian era.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you could see the brand-new lock on my door
you wouldn’t call it nonsense.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Actually! Well, well, I knew he got pretty
savage sometimes, but to lock you in—well, I <em>am</em>
astonished. But I’m the prince come to rescue you
from the enchantment. Now do you regard me
as a particularly steady and trustworthy young
man?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve never thought about it,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I must be,” he said, gaily, “for I suggested taking
you for a motor ride, and maybe to dinner some place
in the country, and here I am. He was crusty about
it for a few minutes, but I convinced him you’d be
safe with me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Safe with you.... Yes, you must have convinced
him of that. I’m sure he wouldn’t allow me
to go out of the house with anybody he didn’t trust
fully.” She eyed him without enthusiasm. She was
about to add something, but thought better of it.
Then: “Do you mean that father has constituted
you my escort? Is that it? That I’m to be allowed
to go abroad with you—to keep an eye on me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s not a pretty way to say it, Miss von
Essen.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s the fact, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I shouldn’t say so. If I were describing the thing
I’d say that your father thought I was a reasonably
decent fellow, and was willing to trust you with
me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“My father is afraid to allow me at large?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why, he seemed to want to keep you under his
eye.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“For an excellent reason?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Undoubtedly he has a reason.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If he is afraid I’ll do something if I get out of
the house, how does he suppose you can prevent
me?... Especially in a public place. Suppose I
were to decide I wanted to be alone—to leave you.
How would you prevent it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He didn’t appear to worry about that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t <em>you</em> worry about it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not a bit.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now, Miss von Essen—I’m just the pleasant
young man who is allowed to run around with you.
I don’t know why I’m allowed, but I’m delighted
that it’s so. I’m sure if your father trusted you to
me you wouldn’t do anything to get me in bad with
him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He moved his chair closer and leaned forward.
“You haven’t seemed happy with your father?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m not,” she said, sharply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why don’t you get away from him, then?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” she said, with a wry smile, “there’s the
new lock, for one thing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know something that will unlock it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“For instance?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Marriage.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She stared at him, quite taken by surprise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Exactly,” said he. “You know, Hildegarde,
I’ve been attracted by you. You’ve seen that....
You couldn’t help it. I’d have told you before this—that
I love you and want you to marry me, but the
moment never seemed to come.... But I can
tell you now.... You’re unhappy here. Something
has gone very wrong.... I offer you a way
out—and once married to me, you are free of Herman
von Essen—free of him forever.... Won’t
you think about it, Hildegarde? I wouldn’t be such
a rotten husband, and I’m mighty fond of you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’re—actually—proposing marriage?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I love you,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her eyes blazed. “Did you and father think marriage
would close my mouth?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t understand you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You think if I were married to you you would
have me safe. Oh, you understand me, all right....
I’m not so blind. You know I’ve suspected
you, and now I know. I know.... This <em>proves</em>
it. I know who you are.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who am I but myself?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are the man who was in this library talking
to father. You are the man who trapped him; who
forced him to be a spy and a traitor.... Not that
he needed forcing past anything but his cowardice....
You’re a German spy, in command of German
spies. You’re the man who plans these explosions
and fires and murders—and sets tools to carry out
your plans....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nonsense!” said Cantor, with an easy laugh.
“You’ve been having nightmare. Why,” he declared,
“I’m French! At least I was born in Alsace.... Wherever
did you get such a notion?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s the truth.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He laughed again. “Of course I can’t prove that
I’m not—any more than you can prove that I am....
And meantime I love you very much indeed
and am asking you to be my wife.... Now don’t
refuse offhand. Take time to consider.... You
don’t want to be shut up in your room for months,
maybe years. Your father seemed to have the notion
of imprisonment for life.” He showed his teeth
in a smile that seemed to say he appreciated the humor
of the whole thing. “I offer you a way out, and
not a hard way.... You can’t dislike me so much,
or you wouldn’t have been willing to play around
with me the way you have. Just think it over and
you’ll see lots of advantages.... Why, we can end
this disagreeable situation this afternoon! Throw a
few things in a bag and come with me. We’ll be
married and telephone your father. He’ll rage, but
you’ll be out of his reach.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She sat silent, bewildered, more terrified by this
new development than by her father’s rage and her
imprisonment. She was afraid of Cantor’s suavity;
she was afraid of his power, afraid of what he and
her father might plan and carry through with her as
its victim. It was sinister, threatening.... And
what she knew of this man did not lead her to think
of him as a man who married.... As she was she
might lose her life or her reason, but something told
her that if she became Cantor’s she would lose her
soul.... Potter Waite arose before her, and her
love for Potter Waite—her love that could never
come to fruition....</p>

<p class='c004'>She pondered, and her keen, restless brain darted
here and there like some small imprisoned animal
seeking a way of escape, but everywhere encountering
the bars of the cage.... One thing she saw—she
must not refuse Cantor with finality. She must
leave him uncertain, with hope or reason to believe
he might find her malleable in his hands. She must
not offend him; she must put him off from day to
day for her own safety, hoping for the unexpected
to intervene. They hoped to shut her mouth by
marriage. She would hold them in suspense and
gain what advantage a moment might vouchsafe to
her. At any rate, Cantor meant liberties for her;
meant that she would be allowed to leave her room,
to go about the city with him, to divert herself, to
find relief in gaieties and in matching her wits against
his.... This she saw.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not now—not to-day,” she said. “Wait....
This is a new thought to me.... I don’t know....
Will you go now and let me think. Please go
now—and come to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“For my answer?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I won’t promise that—but come.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He lifted her hand to his lips. “To hear is to
obey,” he said, gaily. “At least I may hope.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She found herself alone and tired, so tired. “You
can hope,” she said to the vanished Cantor, “but
there’s no hope for me—in all the world there’s not
a ray of hope.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>In those days it was impossible to carry on a conversation
with Potter Waite on any subject but
aviation. No matter where the talk started, aeroplanes
seized it and flew away with it. He was a
man preaching a crusade, and he preached it with an
intensity, a fire, a grim fanaticism that caught and
carried away his hearers if only for a moment of
enthusiasm. He had the gift to make men see, and
such singleness of purpose as somewhat nonplussed
the careless and irritated them with the itch of
accusing uneasiness. He would have had every man,
woman, and child in America working to give America
wings. He preached a religion, and the creed of
it was, “By aeroplanes alone shall ye be saved.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Men not yet touched by the gradual awakening
of the nation avoided him as one infected, for he did
not mince words with them, nor choose terms. He
was intolerant with the intolerance of youth; impatient,
restless, with an impatience and restlessness
all his own. He burned. When he talked his hands
were never still, and his eyes would grow hotter and
hotter with the fires of his purpose until it made one
uncomfortable to return their gaze. With men of a
certain type he had scant popularity, which he was
at no pains to increase. He did not seek
opportunities to make himself heard, but if men would
talk to him they must listen to what he had to say.
Only once did he speak in public, and that was without
invitation or premeditation. The occasion was
a noonday luncheon of manufacturers in the Board
of Commerce dining-room, where they listened to a
millionaire manufacturer invited to speak about
newly arising problems of labor.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a smug talk, with the jingle of dollars
playing an obbligato through its length; it was a talk
characteristic of the opinion and the lethargy of the
day; characteristic of the individualism of the Middle-Westerner.
It contained polite references to the
war and to the flag and vague reflections as to the
high duty of Detroit and Detroit’s wealth to lay
some unspecified contribution on the nation’s plate.
Probably the speaker imagined himself to be a patriot;
his hearers applauded. It was a comfortable
speech that caused no unpleasant notions to present
themselves, and offered a sort of royal road to patriotic
service. Potter listened and scowled and wriggled
uneasily in his chair.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the speaker had emptied his reservoir the
chairman invited discussion, and more than one well-fed
man of business arose to place his O. K. on the
splendid sentiments which had drenched them....
Potter sat on the edge of his chair.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Our duty lies in production,” a gentleman stood
up to remark. “Production will win this war, and
that is our part. We must see to it that business goes
on as usual. We must raise food for Europe and
manufacture supplies for Europe. There is America’s
great opportunity, and, as I look about me at
the character of this gathering, I see that Detroit
can be depended upon to do her part. The country
must not be disturbed....” And five minutes of
such clarion words. The speaker subsided and Potter
leaped to his feet and glared about him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mr. Chairman,” he said, intensely, “I’ve sat
through an hour of this twaddle, and, by Heaven!
I’m sick!” He paused, careless of a hostile movement,
of scowls, of whispers. “As I understand
these men, we are not going to war beside England
and France; we are invited to a comfortable, cozy
opportunity to play we’re at war and to milk our
allies for our own enrichment. That seems to be
the idea expressed here to-day. I’ve even heard the
word patriotism mentioned. Why, you fellows don’t
know whether you’re living in America or in China,
and you don’t care so long as the money keeps coming
in. You have the idea America has gone to war
as a salesmanship campaign for your merchandise....
You’re ducking and dodging war; you’re side-stepping.
You’re talking nonsense about labor....
Do you know what’s going to become of labor—and
capital, too. It’s going to Europe with guns in
its hands and it’s going to fight. You want a war
without fighting. You’re asleep; you’ve drugged
yourselves; but you’re in for a waking up. There
are men in this room who will lie dead under French
soil before another year is gone, men here whose
sons and brothers will lie dead or come home ghastly
wrecks ... and you’ll be proud and glad it is so.
That’s what’s coming. You’ll learn to know America,
and you’ll learn what it is to love your country....
If you want to know what war is, let yourselves
think about the murdered children, the raped women,
the butchered men of Belgium and France....
That’s war, and America is sending her men to give
their lives so the children and women at home may
not be murdered and violated.... It isn’t a smug,
comfortable thought. America is going out to kill
a wild beast, and America will be torn by that
beast.... Business as usual! Great Heaven! but
you should be ashamed of yourselves!... Go home
and <em>think</em>. Go home and shake yourselves awake,
and then go to work—for your country. And for
God’s sake quit making public spectacles of yourselves
by talking the kind of nonsense you’ve talked
to-day....”</p>

<p class='c004'>He sat down suddenly amid a dead silence. The
room quivered with fury; more than one man sprang
to his feet to pour his outraged dignity upon Potter’s
head.... But from the other side of the room a
big man pushed his way to Potter’s side—a man who
long before America entered the war had fought for
preparedness and earned his enemies. He put out
his hand and said, in his big, strident, rough voice:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Give ’em hell, boy. You’ve got the idea. Let’s
get out of this place. It stinks.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter had been unfair, but he did not know he
had been unfair. Those men meant better than
they had spoken, and their intentions were good.
They had not comprehended yet, that was all—not
the greater part of them. But already there was a
growing, silent minority who looked ahead and saw—a
minority which was getting ready mentally, and
which, with an avalanche from the majority, would
one day stand up to its duty as Americans with love
of America in their hearts.... The time was not
distant, for events were lunging forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter and his friend walked out of the room and
into the street. “They’ll say some nasty things
about you, Waite,” said the big man, “and rake up
old scrapes. Don’t let it worry you. Stick to the
gait you’ve struck. You’re tackling a big job, and
I like the way you go at it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Aeroplanes—” Potter said, quickly.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the big man interrupted: “Now, now, keep
off me. I know about your aeroplanes. You don’t
have to convert me.... How’s it coming, if it’s
allowed to ask?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Delays and delays. The steel-mills are delayed
by the mines; the machine-works are delayed by the
steel-mills; the whole of them are messed up by
labor shortage, and when they get a machine ready
for delivery the railroads catch it in an embargo or
run it on a side-track and forget it. But we’re making
progress. Maybe by November we’ll get down to
brass tacks. If we can only get the necessary machinery
for quantity production installed.... I
don’t think we’re as bad off as the people who will
assemble the ’planes. They’re up against it for
spruce and linen.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If there’s ever anything I can do—I’ve offered
my entire plant to the government, but can’t get
any satisfaction. Meantime I’m manufacturing
army trucks day and night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If only that herd—” Potter began, angrily.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They’ll come along, Waite. You’ll see. They’ve
traveled quite a distance since April sixth.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter got into his car and drove away. He was
seething. His mind was in a tumult, for the noon’s
events had excited him, and for months he had been
under a strain which was beginning to wear the insulation
off his nerves. He lived in a fever; drove himself
and everybody else feverishly. At last the
energy which had made his youth fertile for the sensational
press was finding an outlet, and the burning
urge of his restless soul was compelling him to a
headlong pace that permitted no rest, no conservation
of powers. He was a man driven.</p>

<p class='c004'>This noon he felt breathless, confused. It was
as though something opaque kept flicking back and
forth across his eyes, clouding his vision. He could
not concentrate; felt he could not bear to step into
a room, shut the door, and sit down to a desk. He
knew he would be useless, that he would accomplish
nothing, so he headed on out Woodward Avenue,
not turning east at the Boulevard. He wanted to
get away from human beings, to be alone and to
quiet himself. The calm of the country drew him,
and he longed, without realizing his longing, for the
soothing hand of open places and sweet air. He even
thought of playing golf—a round of golf would settle
him down, and he could make up for it by added
hours of work that night.</p>

<p class='c004'>He passed through Highland Park at a speed
which excited the interest of traffic officers. When
he left Royal Oak he stepped on the gas pedal with
a fierce, breathless enjoyment of the excitement of
high speed. Beyond Birmingham, once a distant
village, now a suburb of Detroit, he turned westward
over the road that led to the Bloomfield Hills
Country Club. There he parked his car and, without
caddy or companion, strode out upon the links,
playing savagely, rapidly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Only here and there was a player. Potter encountered
no one until he was well away from the clubhouse.
Then ahead of him he saw a man and girl,
with a second man in chauffeur’s livery carrying the
caddy bags. He did not glance at them, but played
feverishly on until he overtook them sitting on
a bench beside the tee.... It was Hildegarde
von Essen, Cantor, and Philip, the von Essens’
chauffeur.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was like a blow. He had last seen Hildegarde
in Washington, and there Hildegarde had repeated
her confession—that she loved him and could not
marry him because she was fit to be no man’s wife.
And he had wrung from her, or believed he had wrung
from her, the admission that Cantor was the cause
of her catastrophe.... And here he found her with
the man, chaperoned by a chauffeur, playing golf
as casually as if the man had a right to her companionship
and friendship; as if he were not something
that should be inexpressibly repulsive to her, terrible
to contemplate.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter stopped fifty feet away from them and
glared. It was unthinkable, searing. In his soul
he could not believe that relations could have continued,
yet what else did the fact indicate? Opaque
blurs danced before his eyes; he felt a geyser of passion
boiling up within him, a geyser of rage and
horror, mingled with the agony of a love such as
only a man of his temperament could know.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was not given to him ever to count costs, to
look to the future, to perceive results. Now he had
but one thought—that Cantor was there, that he
hated Cantor, that the Lord had delivered Cantor
into his hands. He strode forward and confronted
Hildegarde.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What does this mean?” he demanded, hoarsely.
“You here with this man!... My God! are you
proud of this thing?... Defiled! Aren’t you satisfied
with <em>that</em>? How you can endure to see him—”</p>

<p class='c004'>Cantor was on his feet, amazed. “Here, Waite,”
he said, “what’s this?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hildegarde stood beside him, white, very slender
and boyish, an inferno of suffering in her eyes.
“Potter.... Mr. Cantor,” she said, in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter did not look at Cantor, was not ready for
Cantor yet. He had first to show his scorn for Hildegarde,
his revulsion from the conduct she had
chosen for herself.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s hideous,” he said, slowly. “There’s such a
thing as shame.... You can go about with this
man—when you ought to want to kill him.... This
whelp....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Potter—what are you saying? What do you
know?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you please, Miss von Essen,” said Cantor,
stepping between her and Potter. “Now talk to
me,” he said, evenly. “What’s the matter with
you? Are you crazy?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter looked into Cantor’s eyes an instant before
he spoke; then he said, with quiet intensity: “There
isn’t much I can do about it, Cantor.... There’s
no way of giving you your deserts, but I’m going to
do the best I can.... I’m going to thrash you till
you whimper. I’m going to hammer you till you
crawl on your knees to Miss von Essen and beg
her forgiveness—for a thing that can’t be forgiven....
You swine!” He struck suddenly, viciously,
and Cantor went down. Before Potter could spring
over him something thudded dully on the back of
his head, the world seemed upheaving and splitting
apart, and he staggered, swayed, and sprawled upon
the ground at Hildegarde’s feet.... Philip had
struck him down with a driver from the caddy bag.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hildegarde uttered a single cry and threw herself
above Potter, shielding him from the possibility of
another blow.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You sha’n’t!” she cried. “You sha’n’t hurt him!
Leave him be.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Cantor struggled to his feet, his face livid, his mouth
cut and bleeding. Hildegarde glared at him, drawing
herself closer to Potter, who lay without movement.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the matter with the fool?” Cantor said,
harshly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t understand,” she said, “but you sha’n’t
touch him. He sha’n’t be harmed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Cantor glanced at Philip. “I guess he won’t
bother us for a while,” he said. “The wild man!...
Is he jealous—is that it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>She did not reply, but tried to raise Potter’s head
to her lap. “Get water,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Cantor bent over to examine Potter’s head. “He’s
all right,” he said. “He’ll wake up in a minute, and
when he does—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“When he does,” she said, “we’ll get him to his
car.... Poor boy! It’s been hard—he’s had a
hard time.... Oh, Potter, it’s been hard for me,
too!...”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Look here,” Cantor said, ungently. “What
about this? Had you any idea this lunatic was
planning this sort of thing? What does it mean,
anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hildegarde was bewildered herself. What did it
mean? What had Potter’s words meant? Did they
signify that he knew who Cantor was, had discovered
her father’s guilt? She held that fear, but put it
away from her. It was something else, something
she did not understand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It means that he loves me,” she said, piteously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It looks as if it meant that you loved him....
Is that it? Have you been making a fool of me?...
Tell me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Love him?” she said, with a sudden intensity.
“I love him with every breath I draw.” Her voice
broke and failed. “But it’s no use—no use.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter stirred, opened his eyes and shut them
again, breathed heavily, and struggled to sit up. He
peered about him dizzily, saw Cantor bending over
him, looking down calculatingly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I knew it was you,” Potter said, queerly. “Was
the ’plane smashed?... What are you doing here,
Cantor? Where’s Miss von Essen?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m here, Potter,” she said. “Are you hurt?
Can you stand? Don’t try to stand. Wait! Let
me wet my handkerchief. There’s water over on
the green.” She got up and hurried to the putting-green.
Potter shook his head. “I thought—” he
said, and stopped. “You were there,” he said to
himself. “I always thought you were there. I was
sure I saw your face.”</p>

<p class='c004'>In a moment his brain cleared and he remembered.
“You dog!” he said, his eyes blazing as he tried to
get to his feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>Cantor pushed him back. “Be quiet,” he said,
“or Philip will hand you another lesson. What do
you mean, you fool, going around roaring like a
lunatic and starting rows?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mean?... She told me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Told you what?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That she was—defiled.... That you—”</p>

<p class='c004'>Cantor laughed. He understood, and, being an
opportunist, availed himself of the opportunity.
“What’s it to you?” he said. “Miss von Essen can
choose her—friends.... What’s there to rave
about?... If a pretty girl throws herself at your
head, do you call a policeman?”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was confirmation; the thing was past doubting.
Potter got to his feet just as Hildegarde returned with
her wetted handkerchief, which she would have applied
to his wounded head, but he repulsed her, would not
let her touch him, and stood wavering dizzily.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Just a moment,” he said to Cantor, “and we’ll
finish this.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Cantor smiled grimly. “Philip,” he said, “I
haven’t any desire to brawl with this fellow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Philip came forward eagerly, the driver ready in
his hands.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t, Potter,” Hildegarde said. “Go away.
You don’t know these men. You don’t know—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Miss von Essen!” said Cantor, sharply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There are two of them.... Go away, please....
And you’re hurt.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You won’t fight, man to man?” Potter said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why should I?” Cantor said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter turned and looked at Hildegarde, looked at
her as a man looks at a loved face that is vanishing
forever out of his life. Then he turned on his heel
and walked unsteadily away. He went straight to
his car, stopping for nothing, and drove it out into
the road. His sensation was as if his mind were
alive in a dead body. But the mind was alive,
queerly, keenly alive, and, strangely, it was not
busied with Hildegarde von Essen, but with Cantor.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was recalling the day his ’plane had swooped to
destruction on that little island in the waste of
Muscamoot Bay; he was recalling that moment of
consciousness after the fall and how a man had appeared
and bent over him.... When he had
awakened just now he had fancied for a moment it
was that same catastrophe, that he had fallen from
his ’plane, and was looking up into the face of the
man who had stood above him.... And he knew,
he knew past all doubt and disbelief, that the two
men were the same. Cantor had been on that island.
Cantor had conveyed himself and Hildegarde to the
hospital, had moved the wrecked aeroplane to the
distant shores of Baltimore Bay.... Cantor had
kept hidden his knowledge, and the fact of his presence
on that spot.... With a rush came realization
of the strangeness of these facts, a bewilderment, a
burning curiosity to know what was the meaning of
the riddle—and a suspicion of Cantor which demanded
investigation and verification.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who is this man? What is he doing here? What
is his real business? What does he want to conceal
on that island?” These were questions which presented
themselves and demanded an answer.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Time is an eel. No matter how you sand your
fingers, it wriggles through and is gone. One
sets an act for to-morrow, especially if one be laboring
as Potter Waite was laboring in those feverish
days, and awakes suddenly to find it is next week
or next month—and nothing had been done. When
every hour of the day is carrying a double freight of
necessary things to be done, the urgent thing that is
capable of being pushed ahead finds itself moving
hopelessly into the future.</p>

<p class='c004'>When Potter drove to his office from the Bloomfield
Hills club he was a man of single purpose, and
that purpose was to pry into the affairs of Cantor
until they lay upheaved for any man to view. He
suspected Cantor, he knew not of what, but of something
sinister. It sufficed, in such times, that the
man had something to conceal; that the truth of him
was not held up to public view.... And Potter
hated him.</p>

<p class='c004'>As with every other man, he had used the word
“hate,” but he had never understood it. Now he
knew that it had a very special and exact meaning,
and he could have defined it with precision—not in
words, perhaps, but by acts which speak with an
eloquence words can never hope to achieve. One can
describe with words a sunset, a hurricane, the eruption
of a volcano. But when one is done there is
nothing but vowels and consonants arranged in a
certain order. They may convey a suggestion, but
no more. A printed page, no matter from what
master’s hand, remains a printed page. It is not
sunset, hurricane, volcano. So with hate. It cannot
be stamped upon paper; it can be indicated by conventional
signs; but those conventional signs mean
nothing but a vague hint to the individual who has
not experienced the <em>thing</em>. Potter Waite experienced
it. He hated Cantor, and when that is said words
have reached their limit in denoting that human emotion
which is the reverse of love.</p>

<p class='c004'>But he did not act. He worked. No man who
has not waited through days of construction to see
a new mill begin the business of its existence, to see
the shafts revolve, carrying with them their multitude
of pulleys, communicating energy from the
power-plant to the machine of production, does not
know impatience. He is looking forward to the day
when machines, perfect and exact for their appointed
work, shall produce a concrete thing that can be
seen and felt. It is not enough to know that each
day brings nearer the concrete thing. No man but
a mill man, skilled in such matters, knows what delays
intervene, what errors creep in, what changes
have to be made—and what a pall of anxiety hangs
over the whole.... Once there was a mill which
started up and ran flawlessly when it was completed.
The residence of that mill is in a fairy-tale....</p>

<p class='c004'>In early September the strain of anxiety was
everywhere present in the huge rooms which were to turn
out the motor of victory. There was a breathlessness,
an apprehension, a realization that something was
wrong, and a sense that things more catastrophic
were gestating in the womb of the future. <em>Something
was wrong.</em> Engineers, superintendents, machinists,
were given to sudden ravings. Small things caused
a condition of constant irritation; an occasional big
thing brought down an avalanche of consternation.
Men did not say that <em>something</em> was wrong; they
said <em>somebody</em> was wrong. And somebody <em>was</em> wrong.</p>

<p class='c004'>An atmosphere of suspicion arose like a dank fog,
and every man looked askance at his neighbor—for
he knew in his heart that that neighbor might
be the man; might be spending of nights money that
found its way into his pockets from the huge sums
Germany was reported to have placed in America
to hamper America’s preparations for war. Some
man, some <em>men</em>, were hampering the work in that
plant; it was a patent fact. Some men who had
passed the inspection of government investigators
and who wore the guise of honest American working-men
had sold their souls to the German devil. Every
honest man in that plant knew that when he sat
down to eat his lunch at noon he was eating in the
presence of traitors and spies.... It was not a
condition calculated to soothe.</p>

<p class='c004'>The work of sabotage was skilfully performed, as
if by the black enchantments of an evil magician.
Its results were there, but none could say how or
by whose hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again and again Potter demanded results of the
men of the Secret Service, but they gave no results.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There must be suspects,” Potter declared, vehemently.
“Whom do you suspect?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Everybody,” said Downs, who was in command.
“I suspect first those men who have the most unimpeachable
antecedents. It is a safe rule in these
days to suspect the man who is above suspicion.
The Germans are thorough. It looks as if they had
caused their agents to be <em>born</em>, and reared them for
thirty years for this work.... Mr. Waite, the man
who is planning and carrying out this business in
Detroit is a great man.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’s got you beaten?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll get him,” said Downs.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But meantime he is putting off by months the
manufacture and delivery of aeroplanes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was not alone the work done under that roof
that went awry. Machines and tools were manufactured
for the business of machining motors in a
score of plants in Detroit—and they must be tools
of a marvelous delicacy and exactitude.... What
percentage of them were delivered in a useless condition
will never be known, for it was a matter upon
which the Signal Corps imposed secrecy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s an army of spies in Detroit,” a manufacturer
declared to Potter. “Every plant is full of
them—and how can we prevent it? Detroit was made
to their order. Our growth has compelled us to
scour the earth for labor, and we have imported
labor by the excursion-train. In ten years half a
million strangers have come to Detroit.... They
haven’t been watched. In some countries, I’m
told, the police have the <em>dossier</em> of every citizen.
In America the commissioner of police of a great
city probably hasn’t the <em>dossier</em> of the chief of the
force. My plant is full of spies, your plant is full of
spies, and before God I see no remedy for it or protection
against it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I was confident of delivering motors in November,”
Potter said. “Maybe now I can make deliveries
in January.... If that isn’t equal to a victory
in a pitched battle, then I’m an imbecile.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nobody realizes it. The Liberty Loan did something
toward bringing the war home to our people,
but it was only a beginning. Detroit rushed and
pawed to make up its quota—but, after all, it was
only a pocketbook affair. It brought no suffering,
only benefits to most. It introduced the man with
fifty dollars to investment. It made men fancy they
could be patriots for a fifty-dollar bill. But it was a
step toward arousing the people. We’re nearer.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“When they give their sons—” Potter said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It will come closer then. The draft was a big
step—and the people’s attitude toward the draft
was an eye-opener. I’ve a notion we men who like
to think we’re the most important thing in the
nation, we wealthy men, don’t really know what
the people are thinking about. Maybe they’re more
serious than we think? Maybe there’s more genuine
love for America in them than we think.... A year
ago I would have said an attempt to draft would
have brought on a revolution.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thank God for the people!” Potter said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But even they won’t feel the war—not when their
sons march off to training-camps ... not until the
cables bring home lists of the dead. Then America
will know it is at war.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter dined at the Detroit Athletic Club that
scorching September day which was to see the first
draft men in their farewell parade. It was almost a
gala occasion. The dining-rooms were crowded
with cheerful men, and some of those men were to
march in the parade. Most of those whom Potter
saw were bent on holiday, wore a holiday expression;
many carried a humorous expression. The air was
not heavy with foreboding, but light with jest. A
spectacle was in preparation for their eyes, and they
were in humor to enjoy it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Men arose and sauntered toward Woodward Avenue.
A man at the next table said, jauntily, “Well,
it’s about time we ambled over to take a look at
the circus.” That was the attitude—a section of the
attitude. Potter wondered how far it went, how
deep its strata extended, how much of it was genuine.
There was a thoughtlessness that offended him.</p>

<p class='c004'>He went alone to see the spectacle. He did not
want companions, but wanted to see, to study, to
comprehend. He was going to the laboratory to
endeavor to assay the American people.</p>

<p class='c004'>From a boy he bought a wooden box and stood
upon it at the corner of Woodward and Adams
avenues. North and south the streets were massed
with such a crowd as Detroit had never before
turned out. Potter watched the section of it that
lay under his eye, and listened for such messages by
word of mouth from the public thought as might
filter to his ears.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the park at his left the very trees bore a human
fruit. Roofs were densely fringed; every window was
filled beyond its capacity—and upon all the pitiless
heat beat down. They waited patiently, for the
parade, like all parades in Detroit, was delayed in
starting. A couple of women fainted—not from
emotion, not because loved ones were marching away,
but because of weariness and the breathless heat.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter studied, but was at a loss for conclusions.
The same holiday air was present; the same lack
of somber forebodings. Once he saw a woman pass
with handkerchief to her eyes, her husband’s arm
about her shoulders. She was giving a son. The
crowd looked after her and whispered, and grew
silent for a moment.... Maybe they did understand,
Potter thought. Maybe this holiday air was
a pose to conceal a dark care. He could not force
himself to believe it.</p>

<p class='c004'>The crowd surged closer, straining eager eyes up
the street, for the parade approached. It came and
passed—fraternal orders, Grand Army men, Spanish
War veterans, home guard, cadet corps—and the
men of the draft.... It was upon the men of the
draft that interest centered, and they came rollicking,
in straggling, unmilitary lines. They, too, apparently,
were bent on holiday, for they jostled,
sang, bandied retorts with the crowd, called joyously
to acquaintances, and filled the air with straw hats.
A humorist had snatched a straw hat from a companion
and sent it sailing into the air. In a moment
the air was full of straw hats and laughter.... And
these men were marching away to be trained in the
business of killing their fellow-men!</p>

<p class='c004'>It was characteristic of America that the draft
men had staged their parade with humorous effects.
They carried signs and banners upon which were
mottoes, and for one legend which was serious,
thought-compelling, twenty were flamboyantly farcical.
There was a fondness for announcing in rhyme
that the Kaiser would be given hell. One man led a
goat which was announced to be the Kaiser’s goat....
Potter searched for a downcast face, a tearful
eye. It might have been that some were present
in that marching line, but he saw none. America was
marching to war with a jest on its lips.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They’ll laugh out of the other side of their
mouths,” Potter heard a man remark, and that was
the nearest he approached to gloomy prophecies that
day.</p>

<p class='c004'>He went back to his work. He had seen, and he
was puzzled. He could not read the meaning of that
day’s spectacle, and it hurt and bewildered him.
“They don’t take it seriously,” he said to himself.
“What does it mean?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Perhaps if he could have stepped into the homes
of those thousands of young men he might have read
a different message; perhaps if he could have seen
the farewells, heard the words of father or mother to
son who was going away from them to fight for the
great issue of the right of individual nations to live,
he might have perceived matters which were hidden
from him. The American does not parade his grief;
does not flaunt before the world his serious emotions.
Those are for his secret heart; not even, save in great
moments, for his immediate family. With a rude joke
and a laugh he puts himself on record, and perhaps
that record lies. There is but one record that offers
verity, but that is a secret record, not open to the
investigator. It is printed in the recesses of the heart.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hildegarde saw the parade, too, saw it from the
vantage-point of Cantor’s office window, and watched
his face with greater interest than she watched the
passing men below. His expression was ironical,
almost sneering. He was studying, appraising. Hildegarde
said to herself that he was formulating in
his mind a report of the thing to be forwarded
through devious channels to Berlin. In due time the
High Command in Germany would have spread before
it Cantor’s well-considered estimate of America’s
draft army, and, if his expression were indicative,
that report would be pleasing to those in charge of
Germany’s military destinies.</p>

<p class='c004'>She mused on her anomalous position—an American
girl, loyal to the last ounce of her blood, in this
room with a man whom she knew to be a German
secret agent. Somehow the thing did not seem so
inexplicable to her, but she considered it thoughtfully.
She knew this man to be what he was—but
had not a scrap of evidence to bolster up her knowledge.
It was her duty to indicate him to the authorities,
but she did not point him out—because she was
tied to the trade he represented by a cable she could
not break.... And she accepted him as a companion
because to refuse to do so was to cut herself off
from companionship. With this man alone could
she move about in the world and snatch such pleasures
and forgetfulness as minor excitements commanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>For a week after that disquieting encounter with
Potter Waite at the Bloomfield Hills club she had refused
to see Cantor; determined she would never
see him, allow him to be her escort or guard again.... But
a week of lonely imprisonment forced her to
give way. She sent word by the man who brought
her food that she would receive Cantor, and he came.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Does this mean that you’re through playing
with me?” he demanded, coldly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have never played with you,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have pretended to consider my offer of marriage.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have considered it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And your answer.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can give you no answer—yet. I—You know
I do not love you. But—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Marry me and I’ll attend to the love,” he said,
grimly. “You suppose you are in love with that
lunatic Waite.... Let me tell you that you may
as well forget him first as last. If you were the last
woman in the world, he would never marry you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She flashed out at him in fury. “It wouldn’t
matter who or what I was,” she said, “Potter Waite
would marry me to-morrow. What do you know
about it? You know nothing about such a man as
Potter; you have no standards to judge him by....
He’s real, he’s honest. He loves me....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’s a fool.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then you could profit by losing your wits,” she
said, sharply. “Suppose we omit Potter Waite from
our talk. It gets us nowhere.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you’ll omit him from your thoughts—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If only I could.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You sent for me,” he said, after a pause. “Why?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Because I’m tired of being shut up in a cage.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Suppose I refuse to take you out of it—without
something more definite in the way of promises?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then I’ll stay shut up.... You may as well understand
me one time as another. If I marry you
I’ll marry you when I’m ready, and not until I’m
ready. I don’t want to marry you. I don’t want
to marry anybody.... But there are limits to what
one can endure. To marry you might be more endurable
than not to marry you.... I’ve seen
enough of life to realize that. I couldn’t have realized
it a year ago. I’m talking frankly to you, Mr.
Cantor.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I agree with you,” he said, ironically.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You seem to think I am desirable as a wife. But
you don’t love me. You have your reasons for wanting
me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Undoubtedly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Would you care to tell me what they are?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I like excitement,” he said, with a grim laugh.
“With you as my wife I would never have to
seek it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“My father is wealthy. I have social position
here.... I suppose, if we are to think about this
as barter and sale, that you have something to offset
that—besides your presence and—abilities.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He drew himself up and stared at her. “I—” he
began, and checked himself. He had been on the
point of a disclosure, she knew, driven by vanity.
He shrugged his shoulders. “You would not be the
loser,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“In case you ever leave America,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In war-times,” she said, “I have read that spies
are shot.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He laughed. “You have that silly idea yet? Well,
so long as you don’t prattle about it, no harm is
done.... And I’ll see to it you don’t prattle.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve thought of offering to marry you if you
would release my father. But that idea didn’t appeal.
I knew you wouldn’t keep your promise ...
so long as he was useful to you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The American family system is a puzzle to me,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You arrange these things better—in Germany?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You would be impossible in Germany or France
or Russia.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” she said. “I am American.... That’s
the terrible truth. I’m American, and I have a
traitor for a father and a spy of the enemy for a
possible husband. Oh,” she said, with a sudden
flux of despair, “why should this thing happen to
me—to me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He offered no sympathy. “Anyhow,” he said,
“you have had to send for me.... And I came.
I’m patient, and you are worth being patient for.”
His eyes glowed as they rested upon her, perceiving
her slender, ardent youth, the fire, the ability to
live, the reckless charm of her. “Let it rest so. We
will go on as before.”</p>

<p class='c004'>And so it had been. She recalled that conversation
now as the music of bands and the voice of
the multitude arose to her ears. So it had been—and
there was no change. His patience and persistence
were unabated; her power of resistance was
undiminished.</p>

<p class='c004'>He turned to her suddenly. “America imagines
she can stand up against Germany’s armies with
those.” He pointed downward. “And these men of
the Middle West and the West are the best you can
give. Look at them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She looked at the straggling lines of jaunty men,
lacking uniform, lacking bearing, lacking everything
that goes to make the soldier, but a something which
was invisible to her eyes and to Cantor’s eyes, but
which is the thing, when all else is judged and
weighed, that carries a man steadfastly, unflinchingly,
into a hell of carnage.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A regiment of Prussians would annihilate an
army of them,” Cantor said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wait six months, a year,” she retorted. “Then
talk.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In a year,” he said, “the game will be played
out. America’s men don’t signify. Nothing she can
do signifies, beyond her money and her munitions....
And those...”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s your business to deal with,” she said,
quickly.</p>

<p class='c004'>He turned around and said, suddenly, “Are you
going to marry me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’d as soon you didn’t,” he said, significantly.</p>

<p class='c004'>She stared at him, perplexed; then she comprehended.
She was not outraged, was not even angry.
The thing she had read in his eyes more than once
was not the desire which urges a man to take a wife.
Her lips curled. “I suppose the next step would be
to use me in your trade,” she said. “Spy literature
is full of attractive women used as—shall we say
bait?”</p>

<p class='c004'>His eyes darkened. “If I were interested in such
things,” he said, “I’d say you could fit the part.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s one I’ll never play,” she said, shortly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The future is—the future,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>He turned again to the window; left her brooding,
frightened, staring toward to-morrow and the cargo
of good or ill which to-morrow was freighting toward
her.... She had never considered herself as good
or bad in the way of morals. She had taken herself
for granted, as one who would not be touched by
certain things. They had seemed romantic, fictitious....
She realized that they were real; that no one
is born into the world shielded from them by some
mystic immunity. What other women had been
she might be. She was flesh of their flesh, breathing
the same air, endowed with the same intelligence,
swayed by the same temptations, compelled by the
same events.... To what might not overwhelming
events compel her?... She shrank from the
thought; it was of hideous aspect, and unwholesome.
It was an unequal struggle—one slender girl
against the covetous forces of evil. If evil fixed its
eyes upon her, if malevolent events hustled and jostled
her toward their ends, as events had been jostling
her—what refuge had she? She was conscious of a
strength of resolution, of a righteous aversion, but
would their strength prevail against such potence as
would be arrayed against them? It was a question
she could not answer until the future demanded an
answer from her. Only the conflict could make
manifest the truth. It lay with her own soul, and
she could not inventory her own soul. Nothing but
the pressure of the event itself could do that.</p>

<p class='c004'>Cantor turned to her again. “The parade is
over,” he said. “Where shall we go?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Home,” she said, in a low tone—a frightened,
lonely tone.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve offended you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, I’m not offended. I’m not even surprised.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good,” he said. “Suppose, then, we eliminate
the idea of marriage. Substitute my suggestion.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She looked into his eyes with a show of courage,
a show of steadiness, but it was bravado. Her soul
quaked. For the first time in her brief life squalid
evil leered at her from the shadows; she knew it
awaited her around the next corner, licking its
leering, slavering lips. It lay in wait. One unguarded
second, one instant when the protection of
that virtue which is breathed into every woman’s soul
from the great Mother Soul was drugged by stealth
or stunned by brutal blow, and she might be lost.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let us go,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>She had carried herself better than she knew.
Cantor was left perplexed. She baffled him. He
did not know what to think nor what had been the
result of his words.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Through September and October the labor
situation grew more and more acute. It was
not that labor made unreasonable demands which
Potter could not satisfy; it was not class unrest, not
the work of professional agitators—it was fear. Some
agency was skilfully and systematically frightening
the men who worked on the government’s motor.
Potter discussed the phenomenon with his father.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The men are restless,” he said, bitterly. “One
day they’re going to walk out in a mob.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can’t you satisfy them?” Fabius Waite said,
looking at the problem from the old angle of capital
and labor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s a thing that doesn’t enter into it, father.
They’re frightened. They have cause. I’m frightened
myself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ve been delayed. We should have been delivering
in quantities by this date, but what have
we done? Not even a miserable dribble of motors
has gone out. Not enough to experiment with,
enough to play with in a few aviation camps....
But we’ve got to equip an army. Small things
have happened, but every one of them is threatening,
and the men see and worry about them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Bosh!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s not bosh, father! These men aren’t soldiers,
trained to risk their lives. They are ordinary
working-men, trying to support their families. I’m
afraid for them. We’re getting along now, in spite
of all delays. We’re getting in shape to produce.
It’s the moment we <em>are</em> ready that I’m afraid of, the
moment when these sabotage tactics have to be
thrown in the discard. The man who is organizing
this thing knows we will get ready in spite of
all he can do.... He’s planning for that day. I’d
bet my life on it. When we are ready he’ll be ready—and
he’ll strike if we don’t prevent him. The
moment it will pay him best to try to destroy this
plant is when the plant is completed. That would
be the hardest blow he could deliver, and he’s the
man to deliver it. Whoever he is, he’s too much for
Downs and his men.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Get him,” said his father.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ve tried to get him for months, but we’re
no nearer than we were. Downs has rounded up
spies—subordinates, strong-arm men, and that sort.
But they knew nothing. To break up this thing
we’ve got to get the man at the top.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, get him. There’s a way. Nobody is so smart
that he can hide all the roads that lead to him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Downs says—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The devil with Downs! Go after him yourself.
The way for any man to do business is to tackle the
big jobs himself and leave the details to hired men.
It looks like this was the big job.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If a trained Secret Service man falls down on it,
how could I hope to do anything?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Because you’re not a trained Secret Service man,”
said Fabius, grimly. “And because you’ve <em>got</em> to.
And when you get him, get him <em>good</em>.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter went back to his office, not in a happy
mood. He found a delegation of machinists waiting
for him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mr. Waite,” said the spokesman, an oldish man
with hard hands and intelligent eyes, “the men got
together last night and appointed us to come to talk
things over.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What things, Lakin?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It isn’t what you may be thinking, Mr. Waite.
We’re satisfied. Wages and conditions are all right—but
we don’t like to work here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why? What do you want?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The men are afraid,” Lakin said, “and I, for one,
don’t blame them. Work is plenty, Mr. Waite,
and every man can find a dozen places to work where
there ain’t danger of his being blown sky-high.
That’s the trouble.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where did you get this sky-high notion?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The shop is full of it. The men <em>know</em> it. I don’t
know how they know it, or who told them, but
every man is as sure of it as he is of his own name.
Ain’t that so, Jim?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s a-comin’,” said Jim.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who says so?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Everybody. The men know the things that have
happened, and they say something worse is on the
way.... They say it’ll come when the plant’s
done.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Didn’t set any date, did they?” Potter asked,
with a grim smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pretty close” said Lakin, somberly. “And
you can’t expect ’em to hang around, waiting for it.
I’m not goin’ to.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter sat back in his chair and considered.
Something must be done, and must be done at once.
“Lakin,” he said, “hold the men together this
noon. I’ve got something to say to them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right, Mr. Waite, but I don’t b’lieve it’ll
do any good.”</p>

<p class='c004'>At noon Potter went down to the mill-yard, where
a multitude of men were expectantly assembled.
He stood upon a motor truck and looked about him,
and there was a thrill in his heart at the spectacle,
a thrill at the thought that he was the general in
command of all these men. It gave him a sense of
power, a sense of his capability to accomplish.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Men,” he said, “Lakin told me this morning
what ails you. You’re afraid something is going
to happen.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We know it,” shouted a voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Very well, you know it. I’ll tell you how you
know it. It’s because there are spies among you
who are making it their business to spread the news,
to terrify you. They’ve ruined machinery, caused
delays, put every obstacle in our way, and now, when
we are almost ready to do business, they’re working
on you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They’re goin’ to blow up this plant,” a voice
called.</p>

<p class='c004'>“By God!” said Potter, “they sha’n’t!” He
stopped and glared about him. “I say they sha’n’t,
and I’ll see to it they don’t!... This plant belongs
to our country. It’s working for our country to
give her what she needs most.” He spoke in a tone
almost of reverence as one referring to a sacred place,
a sacred thing. His plant was devoted to a sacred
work, and in his heart he had a feeling that heaven
itself would intervene between it and disaster.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Every man of you is an American citizen,” he
said, “or you wouldn’t be here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You bet.... You’re darn right,” men cried
here and there.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Would you fight for your country? If there
was need, would you put on uniforms and go to fight
to save this country? Do you love your country?”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a silence, a scuffling of feet, an uneasy
movement of the mass. “How about it?” Potter
demanded. “Would you fight for America?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I calc’late we would,” said a man; “I done it in
the Spanish War.” His voice was echoed; heads
were nodded. “But what’s that got to do with
it?” a voice demanded. “We hain’t wanted to
fight.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter stepped to the edge of the truck and pointed
his finger in their faces. “Not a man of you need
go back to work. Every man who wants to can go
to the office for his pay....” He turned and pointed
up to the flag that stood out in the breeze from the
flagstaff above the building. “You’re working
under that,” he cried. “We want nobody working
under it who is a quitter. What we want here are
<em>men</em>.... What if there is danger? Your sons and
brothers and friends have gone to face real danger,
the danger of the trench and the battlefield....
Are they better men than you? Are you willing to
admit that they love that flag more than you? If
you do admit it, we don’t want you here....
You’d fight, you say. You want to see your country
victorious.... Well, <em>make</em> her victorious. Her
victory is tied to this plant and to <em>you</em>. Every man
of you is worth a hundred soldiers in France. That’s
what you mean to America. Every motor you turn
out for an aeroplane is worth a regiment. That’s
what your work means.... And you want to lie
down, to quit.... Great God! Is that the sort
of Americans you are?... Go to the office. Somewhere
we’ll find men with <em>guts</em>. This work sha’n’t
fail because a German spy has lied in your ears and
frightened you.... I’m through with you. You’re
willing to let other men do your fighting and face
your dangers—and you go home and hide behind
your wives when danger is only whispered about.
Look at that flag, if you’re not ashamed.... Look
at it good, and ask yourselves if you’d rather see the
German flag flying there? If you would—go on
with this thing. Quit. Take your pay and run.
I want fighting-men. I want men who are willing
to give their lives for America if she needs them. I
don’t want you.... From this minute you don’t
work for me, not one of you. From this minute
every employee in this plant shall be a volunteer,
a man who is willing to <em>fight</em>. This afternoon I
move my office into the shop—to be right there
when the explosion comes that you’re running
away from. If there’s danger I’ll be there to see it
with the men in the shop.... I’m going to fight.
I want to say that I wanted to fight in France. I
wanted to fly an aeroplane over the German lines,
but I wasn’t allowed. The War Department
ordered me to stay here—and why? Because here is
where the war is to be won.... And you’ll have no
part in it. Some day your grandchildren will be
asking you what you did to help America—and you’ll
have to tell them you laid down, that you ran, that
you quit in a pinch. That’s all.... The paymaster’s
office is open and ready.... You’re
<em>fired</em>.” He stopped and glared down at them, and
they stood silent, astonished.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now,” he shouted, “are there any <em>real</em> Americans
among you? I’m calling for volunteers to stick to
the job.... Volunteers. Men who will stick to
me, hell or high water, dynamite or cyclone. Who’ll
stand by America! Who’ll work under that flag!”
He pointed upward again. “I’m through. I’ve
said all I have to say.... Now then, quitters to
the paymaster... volunteers stand forward.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A man at the far edge began to slink away. Potter
watched him in tense anxiety. The men watched
him. Was he the first sheep of the flock? Was he
the first drop of a deluge? They waited a breathless
minute; then a burly man in overalls sprang after
the slinker and caught him by the shoulder.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Git back there!” he shouted. “What the hell
you think you’re doing? Git back there, you—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Stop,” said Potter. “Let him go if he wants to.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’ll stay,” shouted the big man, “or I’ll see
him carried out. He’s a brother of mine. This
hain’t your business. It’s mine.... You git back
there, Bob.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Bob slunk back to his place amid jeers and shouts
from the men, now in motion, milling like a herd of
excited cattle.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Volunteers!” shouted Potter. “Volunteers step
this way!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lakin stepped forward and turned to glare at
his companions. Another man joined him, and
another.... Then the whole throng seemed to
surge forward as if swept by a great wind, and as
they swept forward they shouted. It was a man’s
shout, a shout of victory, a shout of enthusiasm, a
shout which told Potter that something had moved
in their hearts, and the music of it was very sweet.
His face glowed, his eyes burned.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I thought it was in you,” he said, and his voice
was not harsh, as it had been, but clogged with
emotion and unsteady. “I had faith in you ...
because you were all Americans.... Thank you,
men.... The Waite Volunteers.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Lakin jumped to the truck and shook his fist in
their faces. “Cheer, damn you, cheer!” he bawled....
And they cheered.</p>

<p class='c004'>From that day in Detroit a Waite Volunteer was
a man apart; he was different, and conscious of his
difference. He was a picked man; he was working,
not for wages, but for the flag, and he carried himself
with a pride of his own.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where d’you work?” a stranger would ask.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who? Me?... I’m one of Waite’s men.”
Which stood for something and came to mean much....
And of all of them, Potter Waite was proudest.
In the years of his life had been no day like this day,
nor would be again.... He had found an hour of

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Fred la Mothe was giving a party; not
a large party, but one which Fred promised
himself should be memorable. It was a dual celebration.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m pulling a party at the Tuller to-night,” he
told Potter Waite over the telephone. “Double-barreled.
To celebrate my birthday and my election
as secretary of dad’s concern. Dad admits I’ve come
of age; says nobody comes of age until he’s twenty-eight,
no matter what the statute in that case made
and provided believes. He’s giving me a wad of stock
and making me go to work. I guess I’m going to.
So this is a farewell performance. Just a dozen of
the fellows. You’ll be there?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s the use?” Potter said. “I’m cold sober
these days.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come and watch the rest of us.... Sort us out
when it’s time to go home and see that we don’t
bust in on the wrong families. There’ll be a taxi
for every man.... And I’m planning to shoot off
a cabaret stunt that will make Broadway look like
a country lane.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing doing, Fred.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now look here, you and I have played together
since we were kids. This is my big night and it
won’t be worth a damn if you aren’t there. Forget
your infernal motors for a couple of hours and be
a regular fellow again.... I’m asking it as a favor.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well,” said Potter, after a pause, “I’ll drop in for
a while to watch the menagerie, but don’t count on
my yowling with the rest of the animals.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You can be a keeper with a steel prod.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“O’Mera be there? I hear he’s going to fly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Goes to the ground school next week....
We’ll miss Kraemer and Randall. Kraemer’s here
with a brand-new uniform and a commission, but
lips that touch liquor can’t touch his’n while he
wears it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All right. I’ll show up.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter hung up the receiver and arose from his
desk to walk out into the shop. His office was not
where it had been, in the administration wing, but
occupied a corner of the shop itself. He had kept
his promise to the men, and worked side by side with
them, surrounded by shafting and belts, by lathes
and planers and shapers, and the scraping, clanking,
grinding roar of machines that turned out daily more
and more work for the government. He glanced
about him and was proud. Everywhere were units
of motors, parts in all degrees of completion. At
last production had commenced on such a scale as he
had dreamed of, and now only weeks must elapse
before he was turning over to the government a
steady flow of motors that would continue day in
and day out so long as the war demanded them.
It was accomplishment.</p>

<p class='c004'>From the day he had spoken to the men from the
platform of a gray-painted army truck the work had
seemed to leap ahead. The men had put in as their
share something more than mere wage-earning labor.
They had added to it enthusiasm. The spirit with
which they worked day after day was splendid, and
Potter made it no small part of his duty to see that
it did not die out.</p>

<p class='c004'>There were still annoyances, delays, petty mishaps.
The campaign of sabotage had not ceased,
but it had been checked, for Potter had now to
depend upon an army of watchful, eager eyes, the
eyes of every honest working-man, and not the few
guardians set by the Signal Corps.... But Potter
was not satisfied nor at rest. His foreboding grew
as his efforts to lay hands upon the source of the
trouble proved futile. He believed something was
in preparation, that some blasting catastrophe was
being planned and made ready ... which he
seemed helpless to avert.</p>

<p class='c004'>Like all his other days, this one passed too quickly.
There were many times when he would have wished
to be a Joshua. The machinery went to rest, the
army of men filed out noisily, and Potter closed his
door for the night. He drove home through the
coolly pleasant December air and dressed. At
seven o’clock he entered the lobby of the Tuller,
where La Mothe stepped forward to greet him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The gang’s here,” he said. “Let’s make for the
scene of the slaughter.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There were twelve of them, young men all, not one
of whom but carried a name which stood for wealth
achieved or personal success. But it was a dozen
which could be duplicated more than once in highflying
Detroit. They moved in holiday spirit to the
private dining-room to which La Mothe directed
them, and found their places around a long, flower-laden
table. The flowers heaped upon that linen
had taken from La Mothe’s pocketbook a sum which
would have kept a large family in comfort for a
month.</p>

<p class='c004'>A skilfully set table is a beautiful sight. There is
something about the combination of white linen,
flowers, silver, and glass which touches a chord in
the masculine heart.... Perhaps this bears out the
boyish belief that the Chinese place the seat of the
emotions in the stomach. Potter’s eye took note of
the number and variety of the glasses. Michigan
would be afflicted by drought in May, but the drought
had not arrived; here was promised a deluge.</p>

<p class='c004'>The party seated themselves, and as each man
lifted his napkin he found under it a cigarette-case
of gold, engraved with his monogram.... Such
cases, Potter knew, could not be had for a ten-dollar
bill; indeed, he doubted if ten such bills would be
sufficient. This night La Mothe was not flying near
the ground. Financial worries did not seem to hover
in his neighborhood. Those cigarette-cases, Potter
said to himself, would have maintained a soldier in
the field for twelve months.</p>

<p class='c004'>With the cocktail started the entertainment of
which Fred had boasted. A miniature stage with
curtain and scenery had been erected at one end of
the room, and upon it a performance went forward
throughout the dinner. It was there. One might
watch it if he chose, or might disregard it for conversation
with his neighbor. It was an incident,
but not an inexpensive incident. Fred’s idea of a
proper cabaret seemed to consist in such sights as
the safety of the performers would not permit in a
cold room. There was nothing gross. Fred was
possessed of too much of the esthetic for that; all
was artistically done, skilfully done by performers of
no mean grade.... The more perfect the art the
less necessary the apparel—that seemed to be the
basic rule.</p>

<p class='c004'>Eldredge sat next Potter; across from him and
lower down the table sat O’Mera and Cantor, side by
side. Potter had not expected to see Cantor there....
Potter glanced about. There was not a
young man present who could not have afforded to
give this entertainment or who was amazed at the
luxury of it.... He did not glance at Cantor. The
sight of the man was hateful to him; the surge of
hatred which welled up from his heart held him
tense, forgetful of his surroundings, and he sat staring
moodily at the table before him. La Mothe
perceived his mood and called, jovially:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come out of it, Potter. The mourners aren’t due
yet. Wait till we have a little poker.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter smiled back, forced himself to cast off the
mood, compelled his mind away from Cantor. It
was a thing not easy to accomplish. Every time he
headed his thoughts away from the man they dodged
around and approached from a new angle. He
set his teeth and plunged into conversation with
Eldredge. It was not an intelligent conversation,
and more than once, when Potter gave vague replies
or forgot to reply at all, Jack wondered what had
gotten into his friend.... He was thinking now of
Hildegarde von Essen—thinking bitter, unsavory
thoughts. He refused even the lightest of wines,
not because he was afraid of the exaltation, but because
he knew himself, knew his rash impulsiveness,
knew the difficulty he had, sober, to hold himself in
hand. Inflamed by stimulant, he could not answer
for his conduct, and it would be an ill thing to interrupt
La Mothe’s party by flying at Cantor’s
throat.</p>

<p class='c004'>The others were not so cautious. Glasses were
filled and emptied. Waiters seemed to fear some
calamity if a man were left with an empty glass before
him. The party, like all masculine affairs, had
been sedate, a trifle strained at the beginning. It was
easier now. It was no drunken revel, no orgy, but
tongues were set free, wits were kindled, the whole
tone was lifted a key, and the signature was never
in flats—always sharps.</p>

<p class='c004'>The time had been when such a party would have
revolved around Potter Waite, when he would have
given it its tempo—and the others would have found
it not easy to follow his time. His presence was
always desired, yet it was welcomed with a certain
apprehension, for limits known to others did not
bound him. Even now the young men in his immediate
neighborhood felt a premonition that something
reckless would happen. They were doomed
to disappointment. The gaiety went on without
him, in spite of him. He was not enjoying himself;
indeed, he felt out of place and was rather piqued
with himself that he should feel out of place. The
truth was that in one year he had grown beyond
such things; had graduated from that school, and
its curriculum had nothing to offer him. Frankly,
he was bored when he tried to enter into the spirit
of the evening.</p>

<p class='c004'>But his efforts were not long continued. He sat
gravely listening, or covertly watching Cantor and
thinking of Hildegarde. It seemed impossible,
monstrous, that he should sit peaceable at the same
table with that man and restrain his fingers from the
man’s throat.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly he leaned forward and listened. He
could not have told why, but the word “aeroplane”
had touched his ear. It was a charm to command
his attention; it had called to his subconscious self.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” O’Mera was saying, “I’m going to have a
try at it next week.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ve picked the only branch worth a man’s
while,” Cantor said, and Potter was conscious of
wonder at the enthusiasm that flamed an instant in
the man’s voice. He had known Cantor well. Cantor
had been about his hangar, yet the man had never
shown an especial interest in aviation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They’ve loaded me up with the notion that I’ve
got to work,” O’Mera said. “Maybe so, but I
don’t see why it shouldn’t be about as easy to drive
a ’plane as it is a car.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter glanced sidewise at Cantor, saw his eyes
were extraordinarily bright, his usually colorless
cheeks were tinged with red. The wine was exhilarating
him, stirring his blood to quickened movement
and unleashing his tongue. Usually there was
an air of reserve, the appearance of weighing each
utterance, about him. It was not evident now.
Potter set himself to listen.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ll find enough to learn,” Cantor said, and
plunged into an explanation of what must be
learned and how it must be gone about—an explanation
that was thorough, interesting, full of
expert information. Potter was astonished. He
was something more than astonished, he was filled
with a thrilling excitement, the excitement that comes
to a man when he feels he is standing at the gate
of some climax.</p>

<p class='c004'>Cantor was explaining such erudite matters as the
tail-spin, the nose-dive, looping the loop, and how
one gave his machine the spurious appearance of
fluttering downward out of control—so to deceive
an unwary adversary. He was very clear, very
positive. No man, thought Potter, could talk like
that who was not a master of the air, who had not
been a super-skilled pilot.... What did it mean?
Where had Cantor flown? Why had he concealed
this ability?</p>

<p class='c004'>“They tell me,” O’Mera said, “that we’ll get the
final touches in France or Italy or Egypt. I hope I
go to France. Somehow flying in northern Italy,
with Alps sticking up under one, doesn’t sound
attractive.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s not bad,” said Cantor, confidentially, “not
really bad. Just fly high enough. What’s the difference
what’s under you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You talk as if you flew over the Alps every
morning before breakfast,” said O’Mera, with a
laugh. “I didn’t know you had even been off the
ground.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did I say I had been, eh?” Cantor said, a trifle
tipsily. “Did I say I was a flyer? Tell me that?
No, I just told you <em>how</em> to fly. Very different thing.
Everybody knows <em>how</em> to fly. Books are full of it.
I could read it out of books, couldn’t I?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I suppose you could,” said O’Mera, a bit belligerently,
“but you didn’t say that you did. What
you said sounded as if you knew—like it was first
hand.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe it was, and maybe it wasn’t. What’s
the difference, anyhow?” He drained his glass
and looked about for the waiter. “You wanted to
be told, and I told you. And I told you <em>right</em>....
Who said I was ever up in the air?”</p>

<p class='c004'>O’Mera shrugged his shoulders. His Irish head
was hard, and liquor had a way of battering against
it futilely.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And who said I wasn’t?” Cantor wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Search me,” said O’Mera.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, let me tell you something, O’Mera, something
about the Alps.... They can be flown over—because
they <em>have</em> been flown over. Yes, sir, right
from one side to the other.... And who was the
first man that did it? Tell me that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I haven’t the least idea. Ask yourself the
answer.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What difference does it make—so long as somebody
was the first to do it? Somebody had to be
first, before there could be a second. First comes
first—second comes second.” He emptied another
glass and set a cigarette unsteadily in his lips. All
the while he peered at O’Mera with supercilious
and sardonic humor. “That’s <em>fact</em>—isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sounds logical.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Over the top—from the plains on one side to
the plains on the other.... Who was the first
man that did it? You’d like to know.” He lowered
his voice confidentially and said in a stage
whisper, “You’ll have to ask somebody else.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter knew who was the first man to fly over the
Alps. There was little about the history and development
of the aeroplane that he did not know. He
remembered how the newspapers had heralded that
feat and the name of the man who had accomplished
it. The man had been a German, an officer; he
had been decorated for it by the Kaiser himself.
The name of the aviator was Lieutenant Adolf von
Arnheim.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter was excited. Was it a discovery? His
suspicions of Cantor were reawakened, made vivid.
He fancied he now had real basis for suspicion, for
if his intelligence were not at fault the man had
intimated in his tipsy way that <em>he</em> had topped the
Alps in an aeroplane, had even seemed to verge
upon the boast that it was he who had first accomplished
that feat. Potter reviewed the conversation,
weighed and valued each word. Did his desire to
believe the thing make it appear to be true?...
He thought not. He believed he had put a warranted
conclusion upon what he had heard, and that Cantor
in his bibulous state had been upon the verge of
making a revelation.... From that point reasoning
walked in a straight path. Either Cantor was
lying boastfully or he <em>was</em> the first man to surmount
the Alps. If he were the first, then his name was
not Cantor, but Adolf von Arnheim, and he was an
officer in the Imperial German army!</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter argued with himself, presented the evidence
to himself again and again, and scrutinized with what
fairness and calmness was possible. Clearly Cantor
had an unusual knowledge of aeronautics, the
knowledge which only experience could have given—experience
of the most profound and particular
study. Cantor did not seem a man likely to gain
such knowledge from poring over a text-book....
If, then, Potter accepted the conclusion that Cantor
was an aviator, the other conclusion was not so
grotesquely remote. It crystallized his suspicion
into certainty—a certainty that Cantor deserved
scrutiny.</p>

<p class='c004'>Either the man was a boastful, tipsy liar or he
was Lieutenant Adolf von Arnheim, whose tight
lips had been betrayed by the fumes of wine....
If he were von Arnheim, then he was a German, an
officer—and a spy!</p>

<p class='c004'>Here were such suspicions as must be put to the
test, such conclusions as did not admit of delay in
their verification.</p>

<p class='c004'>The matter spread out before Potter with sinister
ramifications. Fact fitted into fact. One of the
facts was young Matthews’s vanished aeroplane.
Granting that Cantor was a spy and one of Germany’s
most skilful men of the air, then the aeroplane would
be in his thoughts as a means to bring about his
campaign of destruction. In the hands of such a
man an aeroplane would be frightfully effective....
Potter’s mind leaped past the basis for his
deductions. If Cantor were von Arnheim, then
Cantor had stolen Matthews’s aeroplane, and Cantor
intended to use it to Germany’s advantage.
Germany had sent him there for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c004'>But suspicion, individual certainty, were futile.
Potter had to know. He must identify Cantor as
von Arnheim past all dispute, and he must do so
quickly, without arousing Cantor’s suspicion....
Cantor unsuspicious was a menace; Cantor with
suspicions aroused would be swift-striking lightning.
He might not be ready to launch his catastrophe,
but let him suspect that he was watched or under
investigation and he would act swiftly, terribly.</p>

<p class='c004'>The last course had been served, the entertainment
on the miniature stage was reaching a climax
of unclothed vivacity, the room was as full of smoke
as the heads of La Mothe’s guests were with the
lilting voices of the wine. Excitement had been
aroused and demanded to be satisfied. To those
young men excitement wore two faces, girls and
gambling, and gambling drew the vote.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who said poker?” Eldredge called.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Clear out these tables.... Bring cards and
chips and card tables,” La Mothe directed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Two tables, six to a table,” Fred said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter made his way to his host. “I’m off,
Fred,” he said. “I’m a laboring-man. It’s close
to midnight.... Somehow I don’t fit in as well as
I used to.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, stick to the finish. I’ll guarantee there’ll
be a finish.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve lost my taste for them,” Potter said. “I’m
sober, and you fellows have a sheet to the wind.
No.... I’m off.”</p>

<p class='c004'>La Mothe shrugged his shoulders. “Sorry,”
he said. “Good night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter went out quietly, leaving behind a party
that would not break up until daylight, a party
who would play for the joy of play, with the blue
sky as their limit.... The dinner with entertainment
and favors had cost La Mothe in the neighborhood
of three thousand dollars. As matters turned
out, it was not such a bad venture in highflying, for
when he cashed his chips at five o’clock in the morning
he found he had paid for his celebration and had
eight hundred dollars surplus to set down on the
right side of the ledger.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Potter went home, but not to bed. He had
arrived at a moment where attention must
be focused upon Cantor. Fact after fact had strayed
into his storehouse, to be put on a shelf and to be
allowed to collect the dust of disuse. Now he
dusted them off and placed them on the counter.
He had not fancied they would stretch out into such
an arresting array. To his mind they were conclusive,
yet among them all was not a scrap of the commodity
known to courts of the law as evidence.
All was suspicion, conjecture—and yet every item
was a fact. Potter knew it to be a fact.</p>

<p class='c004'>First were the facts of that mysterious island in
Muscamoot Bay—Cantor’s presence there, the
strange conveyance of his aeroplane from the island
to the distant mainland. Second were Cantor’s
relations with Hildegarde von Essen. These became
impressive when set with other facts. Third,
the theft of Matthews’s ’plane. Then, in their
order, Cantor’s unguarded talk of that evening,
the possibility of his oneness with Lieutenant Adolf
von Arnheim. And lastly, and very significantly,
the fact that Hildegarde von Essen had been the
one to warn Potter of the attack upon his hangar—that
and her manner at the time, her secretiveness,
her reluctance to disclose the source of her information.
When Potter put together this last point
with the fact of the relations he believed to exist
between Hildegarde and Cantor, he <em>knew</em> it was
Cantor Hildegarde had shielded by her refusal to
answer. She had protected her lover—the man who
had compelled her to utter that word “defiled.”</p>

<p class='c004'>How had Hildegarde come by her knowledge?
was a question he asked himself, and, answering it,
stabbed himself with the hot iron of anguish. Cantor
was not the man to babble. He was not the man
to boast loosely to any living creature, most of all
a woman. But Cantor had confided in her; that
was patent.... But one conclusion was open to
Potter, and that was based on the fact, often repeated
in literature and in life, that there is one moment
when a man will tell a woman anything....</p>

<p class='c004'>Hildegarde, slender, boyish, brightly flaming
Hildegarde, had known that moment. In every man
lies sleeping a potential killer of his fellow-man.
Your sedate merchant, your clumsy farm laborer,
your esthete, your saintly man of God, your mincing
dilettante, all have quiescent within them a
fury, a madness, a savagery which is capable of
placing in their hands the dripping knife of the
murderer.... It quickened and flamed in Potter
Waite, and he hungered, not for honest combat
with an enemy, but to feel that enemy helpless
under his hand, that enemy’s throat twisted and
crushed beneath his fingers.... For he suffered
from the deadliest wrong of which a universe potent
of frightful sins is capable—the pure thing he loved
with purity had been defiled.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is a thing for philosophers to ponder upon
that humanity is not essentially collective, but
individual; it rarely acts in the mass or thinks for
the mass. In the mind of man the little outweighs
the big, if the little be individual and the big a matter
of race or of nation. So Potter lost sight of
Cantor in his larger aspects; submerged the menace
of the German master-spy in the minor offense of
a wrong done by an individual to an individual.
Hildegarde von Essen hid from sight the United
States of America.</p>

<p class='c004'>While his rage was in eruption Potter was no
patriot laboring in the service of his country, but
an individualist of individualists, thirsting for private
vengeance. He plotted revenge.... When a
man begins to plot he begins to reason; reason and
fiery rage cannot dwell side by side in the same brain....
As he thought more rationally it was clear to
him that the most agonizing blow he could strike
Cantor would be to unmask him, to exhibit him to
the world in the loathsome habiliments of plotter,
spy, murderer—and to bring his patient, stealthy
labors to a fruition of futility.... There lay a
vengeance to rejoice in.</p>

<p class='c004'>His thoughts made headlong plunges; it was his
nature to follow them with equal rashness....
Hildegarde von Essen knew Cantor’s secret; it was
in her power to make plain the path that led to him.
If that were true, she should be compelled to make
that path plain so that Potter could follow it—and
he would compel her. He would see her, would
force his way to her, would make her speak.</p>

<p class='c004'>He looked at his watch. It was nearing one
o’clock. As easy to see her now as another time, he
thought, knowing well he would be refused admission
to Herman von Essen’s house at whatever hour
he applied. Better now, hidden by night. He knew
he could reach her. It was rashness, not reason;
if he had acted otherwise he had not been Potter
Waite, but some differently constituted organism.
His decision was made and he acted without hesitation
or dubiousness.</p>

<p class='c004'>Presently he was walking in the direction of the
von Essen residence, along the broad road, lonely
in its blackness. No other human being seemed to
be abroad; he was the sole living atom in a world
of murkiness and shadows, and he moved forward
swiftly, silently, stealthily. Five minutes brought
him to the commencement of Herman von Essen’s
grounds. There he stood against a tree, merged in
its blackness, and strained his eyes toward the house.
It was silent; there was neither light nor motion to
be detected. The house itself was invisible, save as
a black outline upon a field only less sable. Slowly
and silently he advanced toward the house, toward
that window which he knew was Hildegarde’s window.
His pockets were filled with gravel from the
road.</p>

<p class='c004'>A clump of bushes surrounded a tree which stood
close by the house, and he pressed close to them,
became a part of them, and peered upward to locate
Hildegarde’s window.... A handful of gravel
rattled against its glass. He waited. There was
no responsive movement within. He tossed another
handful of pebbles, this time more forcibly.
Again he waited.... He fancied he saw
movement, a something in the window that hinted at
whiteness. He tossed more pebbles.</p>

<p class='c004'>The window was raised softly; he knew who had
raised it, though he could not see. Nothing was
visible but that hint of whiteness.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is it?... Who is there?” Hildegarde
whispered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Potter Waite,” he replied, in a similar voice.
“I must see you. I’m coming up.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No!” she said. “No!...”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m coming up,” he repeated.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You mustn’t!... You don’t understand! If
they found you—”</p>

<p class='c004'>He made no reply, but began to scramble up the
tree and out upon a limb which climbed upward
past the window, not distant from it.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Open the window wide,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You mustn’t come in!... I’ll close the window.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then I’ll come <em>through</em> it,” he said, swinging
nearer.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wait,” she said, and ran to throw a gown about
her nightdress. She reappeared. “Please!...
Please!” she said, tremulously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve got to talk to you,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c004'>She surrendered. “Then quietly ... not a
sound. Oh, you don’t know what you’re doing!”</p>

<p class='c004'>In an instant his knees pressed the window-sill;
her hands caught his arm, steadying him, and he was
in her room, upon the window-seat where she had
crouched on so many ghastly days, through so many
harrowing hours.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Potter,” she said, faintly, “Potter....”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was fear in her whisper, not for herself,
but for him, and there was love, hungry love rejoicing,
even at such a moment, in his presence. He
did not perceive it, did not touch her, rather held
himself at a distance from her. She felt his drawing
away and her hands clutched his sleeve again as
she whispered his name.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is it? Why did you come?... What
has happened?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who is Cantor?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>She gasped, drew back in her turn, frightened
now, not comprehending. “Mr. Cantor?” she said,
so faintly he could scarcely hear.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is Cantor Adolf von Arnheim?” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No.... I don’t know.... I never heard of
Adolf von Arnheim.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you telling the truth?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Potter!” she whispered, and the whisper was
akin to a cry of pain. She bent toward him, her face
close to his face, her eyes seeking his eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I must know,” he said. “I must know who
Cantor is—what he is. I believe you know. That
is why I came.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is why you came?” she repeated, dully.
<em>That</em> was why he had come. Love had not brought
him; he had not been driven to her by his heart.
He had come to ask questions about Cantor—that
was all. She felt cold, numb.... It was a bitter
moment. He said no word of love; he was brusque,
even harsh. He did not put his arms about her
hungrily, nor give her, against her will, another of
those high moments of which she had experienced
too few.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Cantor is a spy,” he said, “a German spy....
I know it. I must have proof.... You know it,
too.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” she said, “I know nothing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hildegarde,” he said, “whatever you are, whatever
you have done, you’re not a traitor....
You can’t be <em>that</em>. You are shielding this man.
Knowing what he is doing, you shield him....
You used to talk about America and patriotism....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m not a traitor!... I’m not a traitor!” she
whispered. “I don’t know anything. I can’t tell
you anything.” Had the hour struck? she asked herself.
Was her father about to be exposed in his
perfidy; was she about to step on the world’s stage
as the daughter of a spy, a traitor, an inciter to
murder? Her brain refused to credit it. The thing
was monstrous, impossible.... She had feared it,
been certain of its coming, but now she denied it.
It could not happen—to her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You must tell the truth,” he said, striving to
make his voice gentle. “You warned me once....
Your warning was true. If you had not known you
couldn’t have warned me.... You <em>know</em>.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No!... No!...”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How did you know they were coming to my shop
that night?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can’t tell you.... I sha’n’t tell you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’re shielding <em>him</em>!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, not him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you love that man? Is that why you protect
him?” Again the personal element was obtruding.
Jealousy showed its face where there
should have been only a calm desire to know the
truth.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hate him! Oh, how I hate him!—more than
anything else on earth!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But you are with him always ... daily. That
doesn’t look like hate.... A girl doesn’t—” He
stopped, could not say the thing, could not tell her
to her face that a girl like her does not become the
mistress of a man she hates.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You don’t know.... You don’t understand.
I can’t help myself. I have to be with him. I
have to, I tell you. Can’t you believe me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why?” he said, briefly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can’t tell you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you know what this man is doing? Do you
know your country is at war, and this man and his
work are more dangerous than an army on the battlefield?
Do you know that? Do you know that for
years he has plotted and worked against America?
That he has burned mills, dynamited bridges, stirred
up labor troubles—bought and paid for murders—for
Germany? You <em>do</em> know. I know that you
know.... And yet you call yourself an American
and say you are no traitor.... You’re as bad
as he.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You mustn’t say that.” Her flaming spirit was
awakened to anger, an anger sending her on as headlong
a course as his. “I sha’n’t listen to it.... I
tell you I hate him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is he Adolf von Arnheim?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is he the man who stole Matthews’s aeroplane?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is he the man who plotted to blow up my workshop?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are not telling the truth.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am telling the truth.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He was silent a moment; then he said, as if dazed
by the thought: “I loved you.... I could love
you. I thought you were everything good and
glowing in the world. I worshiped you.... It
was never you I loved, but a girl who never existed,
some one I mistook for you; ... some one who
never could have become what you have become;
... some one who was honest, not a friend and
partner of spies; ... some one who could never
have been touched by squalid defilement—”</p>

<p class='c004'>She reached toward him and clutched both his
cheeks with tense fingers, drawing his face toward
hers. “Could I help it?” she said, fiercely. “Was
it my fault? Could I say to God, I will not have
this blood in my veins, and force Him to change
it?...”</p>

<p class='c004'>“German blood,” he said, moodily.</p>

<p class='c004'>“German blood,” she repeated after him. “Do
you think I would keep a drop of it if I could open
a vein and let it out? It’s there. I can never get
rid of it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But it doesn’t compel you to this. It’s possible
to be German and loyal.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I tell you I am loyal, Potter Waite—as loyal
as you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who is Cantor?” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you call yourself loyal.... This minute,
if he is awake, he is plotting to blow up the shops
where I am making motors for America’s aeroplanes.
He’s plotting to blow up and destroy other factories
that work for the government.... What if he
succeeds?... If he could destroy our plant and
half a dozen more it would be a greater victory for
Germany than the capture of an American army....
You can stop it. You can tell me what you
know—all you know. It will show me how to reach
him, for I can’t reach him now.... I know he’s
guilty. You can tell me how to prove it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can’t. I tell you I don’t know.... Suspicion?
What is suspicion? You don’t know what you are
asking.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m asking what any American girl, who was
true to her country, would give gladly ... unless
she loved the man.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If Mr. Cantor were a spy and I could give him
to you—if I could give him to you without—”
She stopped, bit her lips. She had almost said,
“without betraying my father.” She went on, hurriedly,
“I would let them kill me if I could give him
to you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I hope,” he said, bitterly, “that you may never
know what it is to love and be forced—forced—to
despise the one you love.... You told me you
loved me—and lied when you said it.... Even
after you had made that confession, after you had
told me that thing, I loved you.... I would have
taken you and married you and it should never have
existed for us.... I could have done that. Even
then I didn’t despise you. It hurt—it was a thing
I couldn’t think of and live—but I didn’t despise
you.... It was only when I saw you with that man,
day after day, shameless—only after you made me
see that loyalty and truth and decency were not in
you, and that you were a traitor to your country—that
I despised you. And even now, if I were able
to see your eyes, I would doubt it.... How can
you be what you are and keep that look in your
eyes?...”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Potter!” she cried. “No!...”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who is Cantor?” he said, harshly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can’t tell you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You see?” he said, bitterly. Then his voice
changed, became charged with emotion, and the
emotion thrilled her, moved her as she had never
been moved. “Even now I could love you; I
could forget—everything but this. You can’t be
<em>bad</em>. Great God! It isn’t possible that you can be
altogether what you seem to be. Tell me, Hildegarde....
You can tell me what I must know.
It’s your duty. It’s a thing your country demands
of you.... It’s your chance. Can’t you see it is
your chance—to keep something of your soul alive?
Do this thing; be loyal in this—and I can keep on
loving you till the end, with the rest blotted out.
I will remember only this.... Think, Hildegarde!...
Don’t let me go now. Don’t leave this thing
as it is....”</p>

<p class='c004'>She was sobbing, clinging to him childishly. The
flame was gone out of her, the light dead; the pertness,
the keenness which had been so much of her
charm, had vanished, and she was nothing but a
broken, wailing child.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, Potter—don’t—don’t!... Don’t go away!
Don’t leave me!... I love you, and I’m afraid!
Oh, be good to me! Don’t speak to me so!...
Hold me; take me in your arms and hold me—so I
can feel safe—so I can know that there is goodness
in the world!... I love you!... I love you!”</p>

<p class='c004'>If she had been clothed in flaming pitch he could
not have resisted her; he must have taken her in his
arms and strained her against his heart if the very
touch of her had eaten the flesh from his bones....
They stood, lips to lips, and the pain of his arms
crushing her was very sweet.</p>

<p class='c004'>He lifted his head. “Tell me,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>She uttered a tiny moan.... It was all a dream.
This moment had never existed. Or, if it had existed,
she had stolen it from bitter fate to be detected
instantly in the theft. “I can’t,” she said. “I
can’t.” She dared not even tell him why she could
not, for that would be to tell the thing she must
conceal. If he only could know—without knowing.
If he only could know that she must act as she did;
that her reason for seeming to be what she was
was not a squalid reason, was not a reason which
would have failed to move the loftiest soul.... If
he could but have that knowledge; have it imparted
to him by some mystic power!... But he could
not.</p>

<p class='c004'>He pushed her away from him. She was glad
she could not see his face, could not be seared by its
scorn nor wracked by its agony. He did not speak
again, but began silently to creep through the window.
She clung to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Potter!” she sobbed. “Not this way! Don’t go
this way!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let go,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her hands dropped to her sides and she stepped
back. In an instant he was swinging above the
ground, a swaying blot against the night; in another
instant he was gone.... She closed the window
and sank upon the seat, her body too frail to endure
the crucifixion of her soul....</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter stood for a moment beneath the window,
then moved toward the front of the house, but
paused abruptly, for steps approached on the driveway.
He pressed himself against a clump of shrubbery
and waited. Two men appeared, passed, vanished.
The incident gripped Potter, tore his thoughts away
from that room above him.... He had come for
information; here was a fact. It was a suspicious
fact to him that two men should slink down that
driveway at two o’clock in the morning. Silently,
craftily he followed. He saw them against the garage
door, was near enough to hear their low voices.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’s gone to bed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not him. Said he’d wait up. This is the hour
we always have to come. He hain’t takin’ no
chances of bein’ seen with us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Rap again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter heard three raps, a pause, then two raps.
In a moment the door opened silently and the men
stepped inside. The door swung to after them. In a
moment a dim fight flowed within, and Potter made
his way to a window in the side. Peering through,
he could see Philip, the chauffeur, and the two men.
The backs of the men were toward him and he could
not see their faces. He listened. Faintly their
voices reached his ear.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Pay-day to-morrow night,” said one of the men.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And see you pay,” Philip said. “Don’t let any
of this stick to your fingers.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The men that earn it git it,” said the man.</p>

<p class='c004'>Philip shrugged his shoulders. “So long as we
get what we pay for, I don’t care where the money
goes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you’re afraid, you better pay off yourself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Fine chance,” Philip said. “Enough people know
me now. So long as we pay through you—and the
others—they don’t get to know too much.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If they get nabbed they can’t give anybody away
but us,” said the man. “Fine for us, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They haven’t been nabbed yet.... And say,
Harker, I want more for my money out of you. The
last week your crowd hasn’t earned its salt. If
the Waite plant isn’t better taken care of, we’ll have
somebody else in charge.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s a tough job. That young Waite has the
men buffaloed. Now we have to look out for the
spotters and for every man in the place. They’re
all on the watch. It’s a wonder we pull off as much
as we do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Philip passed over a number of bills. “Here,”
he said. “Now sign the receipt. The boss is
systematic.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter could scarcely credit his senses. Here
were efficiency and system indeed. He reflected an
instant on the peculiarity of the German mind that
insisted upon system even in its corps of spies, upon
receipts for spy-money, which, doubtless, were properly
filed in some inoffensive-appearing office in the
city—one day to be transferred to Berlin!</p>

<p class='c004'>He had come for information, and here was information.
One of the men who received money
from Philip was a man who received a weekly wage
from the Waite Motor Company.... The gang-boss
of the spies who were working in the plant.
Potter recognized the name, and, as the man turned,
recognized the man.... And Philip—von Essen’s
chauffeur, the man who had struck him down in
Cantor’s behalf that day out in Bloomfield Hills!
Philip, apparently paymaster-in-chief for the master
spy! It was getting close to headquarters....
Did the trail lead from Philip to Cantor? Could
it be followed?</p>

<p class='c004'>He reflected. Here was no time for headlong
action. Now was the moment to exercise guile
and restraint. To frighten the subordinate would
be to warn the superior. To catch the subordinates
would be nothing but a temporary setback; to
use the subordinates as stepping-stones to reach the
chief would be an achievement. He remained
motionless, waiting.</p>

<p class='c004'>Presently the men stepped out of the garage and
stealthily made their way to the street. Potter
did not follow. For ten minutes, twenty minutes,
he waited, then feeling it would be safe to move,
he stepped from his place and crept inch by inch
away from the garage. Presently he got to his
feet and, dodging from shrub to shrub, reached the
street and hastened toward home.</p>

<p class='c004'>It had been a night of nights; a night of bitter
failure, of gnawing suffering; a night of unexpected
success. The success did not uplift him. It was
there. The facts were in his possession to be made
what use of was possible.... He did not continue
to consider them for long. The personal grief
was stronger than the public benefit. It meant
more to him that Hildegarde von Essen was wholly
contemptible than that he had it within his power
to thwart the plot calculated to destroy the thing
his country needed most. In that hour aeroplanes
were less to him than one girl....</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Hildegarde did not sleep until her room was
light with day; she was exhausted in body,
her soul was tried to the limit of its endurance.
Mechanically she drew down her shades and crept
into bed. It was afternoon when she awakened
and dressed herself. She felt strangely calm, almost
detached from herself and the events which thickened
about her. The agony of the night was gone, replaced
by a coldness, a numbness, as if that part of
her which suffered had been deadened by a powerful
drug. She could even reason with herself, and,
reasoning, she reached a determination. She could
endure no more—she would endure no more.</p>

<p class='c004'>Cantor.... She was done with Cantor. Never
again would she accept him as companion. She
would not need what he had been able to afford—an
easy access to the world outside her father’s house.
She was done with her father’s house. She was
done with Detroit, done with every living soul who
knew her. Something assured her that she could
escape, and when she had gained her freedom it
would be to disappear—to disappear forever. She
did not know where she would go, what she would
do, but she would go, and, going, she would vanish
utterly. Hildegarde von Essen would be abolished
and some place another girl would come to life. She
even selected a name for that other girl. It was not
a German name....</p>

<p class='c004'>Some one rapped on her door loudly. It was
an overbearing, domineering rap, recognized by her
as her father’s. It was like him, eloquent of his
personality.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come out!” he called, roughly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you want?” she asked, at once on the
defensive, quickened to a defensive strength. She
was not afraid of him, not afraid of anything. The
time for fear had passed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come out!” he repeated.</p>

<p class='c004'>She unlocked her door and stepped into the hall,
facing von Essen. His heavy face was set; his
mouth, more brutal than Bismarck’s mouth, was
implacable.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Go down-stairs,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Because I tell you to,” he said. “Because I’m
through shilly-shallying with you. Cantor is there....
You’ve put him off for months. He wants to
marry you, and I want to be rid of you. You are
going down to tell him you will marry him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She did not reply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you hear?” he said, roughly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” she said, quietly. “Does he want to
<em>marry</em> me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Von Essen raised his fist above her. “Don’t
fool with me,” he said. “You know he wants to
marry you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The last time he mentioned it,” she said, with a
quiet that should have warned him of some alarming
change in her, “he wanted me—without marriage.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Von Essen growled incoherently. “Marriage or
no marriage, it’s nothing to me.... I’ve given you
to him. I’m through with you. If he’ll marry you,
so much the better for you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“This isn’t Belgium,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>He twisted her about roughly so that she faced
the stairs, then he pushed her forward. “Go
down!” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>She walked with what dignity she could muster,
very white, very quiet. She had no sense of being
outraged; her father’s manner and conduct toward
her did not matter. They did not exist. She
walked slowly, head erect, and entered the library.
Cantor stood expectant.</p>

<p class='c004'>He bowed gravely. “Good afternoon,” he said,
courteously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Here she is,” von Essen bellowed. “I’ve put
an end to her tricks. It will be yes or no <em>now</em>—and
it won’t be no.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She looked at him curiously, then turned her eyes
upon Cantor. “I understand you’ve changed your
offer again,” she said, quietly. “You’re for marrying
me once more.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m for having you however I can get you,”
he said, with a smile. “One hesitates to speak of
love with a third party present, even if the third
party is the father....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“<em>Love!</em>” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>He shrugged his shoulders. “Love means different
things to different people.... I want you.
For me that is love. I want you so much that I
have been patient. I’ve courted you patiently,
haven’t I?”</p>

<p class='c004'>She spoke without volition, automatically, almost
as if the words had been caused to issue from her
lips by some ventriloquist. “Under what name do
you want to marry me? Cantor or Adolf von Arnheim?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He stiffened into immobility; not even his eyes
seemed alive. His face, naturally without color, lost
even the tint which it possessed. In an instant he
was transformed. He was not the careless, mocking-courteous
lover; he was another man, a man of
stern military bearing, a man of purpose, a man
ruthless in carrying out that purpose. Hildegarde
knew she was seeing the true Cantor at last, and she
liked him better. She saw him infinitely capable,
a man to dare and to accomplish, a man to be trusted
by high authority with a mission of life or death.
She almost admired him in that moment.</p>

<p class='c004'>He remained motionless, and she knew he was
not thinking of her. He was thinking of his work
and what this meant to his work. He had dropped
the moment and was weighing keenly, ably, the
circumstance, and planning what he must do as a
result of it. Somehow she felt he experienced no
fear, no emotion of any sort. He merely <em>thought</em>.
His reaction was purely intellectual.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where did you hear that name?” he asked,
presently.</p>

<p class='c004'>He did not ask it of the woman he loved, but of <em>a</em>
woman, any woman, a woman in his power, bound,
capable of being made to speak by means not shrunk
from by the German mind. She was not an
individual to him, not Hildegarde von Essen, but
merely a woman who must be dealt with.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I dreamed it,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where did you hear that name?” he repeated,
and moved toward her. She retreated behind a
great table, placing it between herself and Cantor.
Her father stood uncomprehending, working himself
into a passion, his florid face growing red and
redder, his breath becoming more labored, the
veins upon his forehead standing out with unsavory
distinctness.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I sha’n’t tell you,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Whom have you seen? Whom have you talked
with?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nobody.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who told you I was Adolf von Arnheim?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s true, then.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If it is suspected, it is the same as if it were
true,” he said, and she saw the finality of his logic.
For his secure position to be questioned was disaster.
It was essential that he remain above suspicion.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Call Heinrich,” he said to von Essen.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her father obeyed, and the servant entered the
room and stood stiffly at attention.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you allowed Miss von Essen to leave this
house?” Cantor demanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” said the man.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are certain?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Certain.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you admitted any one to see her? Any
one?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No one has been admitted.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Man or woman?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No one.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Has she been allowed to receive a letter—a
message?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How do you know?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There are two keys to her door. I have one.
Herr von Essen has the other.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“She has had word from outside, recently, probably
yesterday or to-day.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is impossible.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It has happened. How could it happen?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is no way. Her door had not been opened
by any one but myself and Herr von Essen.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Her window?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Guarded from the moment she awakes until
midnight.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But between midnight and morning?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is not guarded. But no one could—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Search her room,” said Cantor. “Look for a
note, a letter, torn scraps of paper, ashes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The man went out. Cantor stood grimly gazing
after him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is it?” von Essen asked, with fear. “What
has happened?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“She mentioned a name,” said Cantor. “Not a
man in America knew that name was mine—not
even von Bernstorff before he went home. But one
man in Germany knew it. Adolf von Arnheim
was reported killed in battle.... Where did you
hear that name?” he said, turning again to Hildegarde.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I sha’n’t tell.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who else knows what you know? Who told it
to you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I sha’n’t tell.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Her father uttered a sound of fury and stumbled
toward her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Von Essen,” said Cantor, sharply, “this is my
affair.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He paced up and down the room for ten minutes,
and none of the three spoke. Herman von Essen
stood panting, glaring at his daughter. Hildegarde
leaned upon the table, hands spread far apart, and
watched Cantor. Another ten minutes passed.
Then Heinrich returned.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well?” said Cantor.</p>

<p class='c004'>The man was shaken. His face was gray, and his
fear was of Cantor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There was no paper, nothing. I examined the
window. There are footprints underneath—in the
snow. Some one climbed the tree. There are
marks on the window-sill.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Were there footprints yesterday?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Johann is sure.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Cantor waved the man away and approached the
table.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Miss von Essen,” he said, “I have got to know
who entered your room last night. I have got to
know who says that I am Adolf von Arnheim. It is
necessary for me to know, so that I can act. Who
was the man?”</p>

<p class='c004'>She only shook her head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What I don’t understand,” Cantor said, as if
to himself, “is why you were told.... If they know,
why haven’t they acted? What does it mean?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you are suspected,” said von Essen, shaking as
though with an ague, his eyes glaring, his face distorted,
“<em>I</em> am suspected. If they get you they get me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You!” said Cantor, with unconscious scorn.
He was not thinking of his tools then, but of his
work. Nobody mattered; he would sacrifice any
one for his work, and von Essen knew it. He was
terrified.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t understand it,” Cantor said, puzzled
by something outside his peculiar experience. “The
Secret Service isn’t climbing into windows to tell
secrets to girls.... There’s something else—something
I’ve got to understand.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You tell him,” bellowed von Essen. “Tell him,
I say.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you want to see me hanged? Eh? Is that
what you want?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Be quiet, von Essen. You’re not caught. Nobody’s
caught. We can’t make her speak.” He
knew Hildegarde, had studied her shrewdly during
the past months, and he was a man trained to assay
character.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll beat her till she speaks,” said von Essen.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No.... It would do no good. I think it is a
trap. I think they have only suspicions. I believe
they prompted her to say that name—and tell them
what happened. That was it.... They suspect,
but that is all.” He paced up and down for another
five minutes. “It means I’ve got to act. I wasn’t
ready, but this forces me—crowds me. You, von
Essen, forget about yourself for a while. They can
trace nothing to you. You’re safe.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You don’t care,” said von Essen, his voice quivering
with rage and terror. “What do you care what
happens to me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Cantor shrugged his shoulders. “There’s work
for you. You know the plan. It must go through
to-night. I can’t wait even to get to the office to
destroy papers. The office may be watched....
I’m going to act.” His eyes glowed with a sort of
enthusiasm. “There shall be surprises for Detroit
to-morrow—fine surprises. Factories in ruins, explosives
dropped out of the sky—and no one to say
how they fell.... I’ll make a circle. There’s no
way to follow me and no way to stop me ...
no anti-aircraft guns to dodge. I’ll fly low and make
sure. They’ve worked a year getting ready to make
aeroplanes, and I’ll destroy it all in an hour—and
I’ll block their river. When spring comes the ore
will be bottled up. I’ve the thing mapped out—first
a circle over town, then I’ll see what I can do
down-river. I think a bomb or two will block the
new ship-channel. There isn’t time to block Lime
Kiln crossing. For that we needed time. Then a
circle back to the Flats and I’ll destroy the piers and
block that channel.... Then to disappear. An
aeroplane leaves no trail....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And leave us behind to take the consequences,”
said von Essen, furiously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’ll be no consequences, you fool, if you keep
your head and follow directions. First, watch this girl.
Don’t let her out of your sight. Sit in this room and
keep her here. Have Heinrich or Philip telephone the
office and order every scrap of paper burned. Then
tell Philip and the rest to leave—and leave at once.
You’ll be safe. Don’t be a fool.... And watch
that girl.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll watch her,” von Essen said, balefully.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m off, then.... Good-by. I hoped to take
you with me, Miss von Essen, but I can’t have a
girl on my hands now.... Maybe I’ll come back
for you—maybe I can come back.... Good-by—and
watch for my little surprises.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He turned and was gone. In a moment Hildegarde
heard the roar of his motor, and, turning,
watched him drive at breakneck pace away from
the city.... She had heard, and she knew that
what she had heard was no idle boasting. She
knew Cantor for a determined, capable man. He
would do, and was able to do, what he threatened—she
was powerless to prevent him.... If she
were free, if she could evade her father, she was
gripped in a vise. Could she name her father a
traitor?... Somehow it was unthinkable. Yet
she could not exist and permit this catastrophe to
fall upon her city and her country. She stared at
Herman von Essen with widened eyes, conscious of
no feeling toward him but disgust and hatred.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You cat!” grated von Essen. “You meddling
cat!... See what you’ve done.... I could—”
He stopped, panting, his face purple, pulses throbbing
visibly in his temples. He flew into a rage, the rage
of the trapped animal, a rage that was half terror,
and hurled curses upon her.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here, thought she, was the man she was shielding.
Here was her father—traitor, brute, and yet of her
blood. For such a man she dared not move to
avert the thing that threatened.... A thought
pricked its way into her consciousness: Was she
keeping silence because of filial duty, because this
man was the husband of her mother and joint author
of her being, or was she avoiding her duty because
she feared its consequences upon herself? Was it
because she shrank from the finger of scorn pointing
to the daughter of a spy and a traitor, because
she could not endure that obloquy?... She considered
it. It was an accusation, direct, demanding
an answer. She met it squarely, looked into
the eyes of it, and knew, knew that she was not
guiltless.... Not father, not mother, nor any
thing created or uncreated was just reason for her
to stand aside and see her country visited with
calamity. She saw truly that there are duties which
are supreme, which cannot be measured, which
outweigh individual considerations, no matter how
high, how holy. Her duty was to God, then to
America, after that to family and self.... She saw
and she submitted.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll do it,” she said, aloud, unconscious that she
spoke aloud.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her father called Heinrich. “Telephone at once—the
office. You know the number. Tell them
to destroy everything—every scrap of paper. Then
tell them to go—to disappear.... When you have
done—go yourself.... Tell Philip.” He stopped,
gulped as if his heart were impeding the passage of
air to his lungs. “Tell everybody.” His voice rose
almost to a scream.</p>

<p class='c004'>Heinrich disappeared. Presently he rushed into
the room. “They didn’t answer.... I couldn’t
make them answer,” he said. “Something’s wrong.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He disappeared. Von Essen was not pacing up
and down the room now; he was running. Cold
sweat dripped from his forehead, yet he was hot,
burning. His eyes burned; his head was on fire.
His daughter could hear the hoarse gasps of his
breathing, could see the labored rise and fall of his
great chest. His eyes were more bulging than ever,
threatening to start from his head, and the whites
of them were tinged with red.... It was frenzy
that she saw, a frenzy of fear. Herman von Essen
felt the noose about his neck.</p>

<p class='c004'>Once he rushed toward her, a light not of sanity
in his eyes, and she cowered back of her table. But
he reeled away, muttering hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c004'>Some one rapped on the door. Von Essen rushed
to it, tore it open. Philip’s wife stood there, a bit
of paper in her hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Philip said to give this to you, sir. He rushed
in, grabbed some papers in a case, and rushed out....
What is it, sir? I’m frightened.... The way
he acted!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Out!” roared von Essen. “Out!” He waved
his hand wildly in her direction, and she fled.</p>

<p class='c004'>He snatched open the paper, read it, lifted it above
his head in a clenched fist, as if he were shaking it
in the face of Heaven. He uttered a sound which
was not a cry, not a bellow, not a cry of agony. It
was compounded of all three—was hoarse, harsh,
piercing. It cut to Hildegarde’s heart with a knife
of terror. She watched her father, bound to the spot
where she stood as if by the power of some magnet.
She could not have moved or spoken.</p>

<p class='c004'>He seemed to snort—to cough. The sounds were
hideous. He lunged forward like a blinded lion,
his hands clutching first breast, then throat, then
temples. As if he had been stricken by mighty ax,
he was no longer erect, was groveling on the floor,
his breath issuing in stertorous, wheezing gasps....
Then he was still.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hildegarde moved along the table an inch at a time,
resting on her hands, pushing first one foot, then the
other, not lifting them from the floor. Her hands
crept along the table, clutching it. She tried to
hold back, but she was drawn, <em>dragged</em>. Inch by
inch she emerged and approached her father. Presently
she stood over him, bent slowly, slowly.
Dropped to her knees and looked upon his face. It
was purple, almost black, distorted, horrible....
She did not touch him, could not have forced herself
to touch him ... but she knew he was dead
... dead!</p>

<p class='c004'>Mechanically she reached for the paper that had
stricken down her father, smoothed it open. It
was brief:</p>

<div class='c006'>They’re hot after me. Look out for yourself.—<span class='sc'>Philip.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>In that first interval she did not cry out for
help, did not rush out of the room in search of assistance,
but remained kneeling over her father’s
body. Horror she experienced, but it faded. Even
the reality of that fear-distorted dead face could
not make fast the grip of horror.... She breathed
deep, and it was a breath of relief. He was dead,
her father was dead.... She threw back her head
and closed her eyes.... She was glad, glad,
<em>glad</em>!... Now she was free. When no help seemed
possible, when there was none to intervene, when
hope was dead, something had intervened....
She was awed by the thought.... Had God Himself
intervened? Was this a manifestation of
Divine power? She believed it, and, believing it,
was glad.... God ruled the world. In spite of
wars and butcheries, of crimes and treacheries, in
spite of horrors and catastrophes, God still sat
omnipotent in His heaven, all-knowing, all-perceiving,
biding His moment.... The world was safe
in His keeping....</p>

<p class='c004'>She was free! Free at last. Free from the dreadful
thing which had gripped her, encircled her....
This thing that lay before her had been her father,
and he had defiled her, daubed her with the pitch
of his own crimes and treacheries.... Well, the
defilement was burned away; she felt uplifted, purified,
purified by fire sent from heaven, by the flame
that had stricken Herman von Essen to death. She
was herself, untrammeled at last.... Free!...
Free!...</p>

<p class='c004'>Presently she went to the door and called. There
was no answer. She rang; no one responded to the
bell. The house was strangely silent.... She
waited, called again, and then went in search of
help. From room to room she went, calling, but
there was none to answer. Not a servant remained.
All had fled.... She was alone, alone in the house
with that which lay outstretched on the library floor.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>On this day of all days dignitaries from Washington
must appear to inspect the aeroplane
accomplishments of the Waite Motor Company.
Potter chafed and treated himself to a scorching
remark or two, but there was nothing for it but to
give them his attention. It meant only delay.
No suspicions were aroused and little was to be risked
by putting off action for a few hours. But Potter
was not one who liked to procrastinate; if he erred,
it was toward the other extreme.... At noon he
was able to turn the dignitaries over to his father.</p>

<p class='c004'>With the return of the men to work after their
dinner-hour he called his secretary.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have a machinist named Harker sent to me.
Then find Downs, and bring him here yourself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The young man went out, and Potter waited with
rising impatience and not without excitement. Angling
for spies is a pastime likely to stir the blood.</p>

<p class='c004'>In fifteen minutes Downs appeared, but not
Harker.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where’s that man?” Potter demanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll see again, Mr. Waite,” said the secretary.
He returned presently to say that the foreman
had told Harker to report to Potter, that the man had
left his machine to do so, and was not now to be found.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Find that man,” Potter said, sharply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you want of me?” Downs asked, when
the secretary hastened out to carry Potter’s
orders.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve found the man who bosses the German
agents in this plant!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“This Harker?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you sent a messenger to tell him to report
to you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mr. Waite, you’re some manufacturer. I’ll
admit that, but you’re a hell of a detective.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t get you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You might as well have sent him a card saying,
‘I suspect you—Skedaddle.’”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You think he’s taken fright?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know it.... Your telephone.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Downs called a number. “Look up the address
in your records of a man named Harker,” he said
into the receiver. “We want him. He just left
the plant here.... Get him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He turned to Potter. “Now,” he said, “suppose
you let me in on this. It’s rather in my line of
work, you know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I suppose I should have come to you at once—but
I didn’t. Here’s what I’ve got.... I have
reason to suspect that a man named William Cantor
is the chief of the German agents in this section.
I believe his real name is Adolf von Arnheim, and he
is an officer in the German army—an aviator. One
of his paymasters is a chauffeur named Philip who
works for Herman von Essen. Last night I saw
this Philip turn over funds to Harker and another
man. There you are.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good work. No time to ask how you got it.
Where does this Cantor hang out?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter gave the address of Cantor’s office. “I
never did know what his business was.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can we have a car—quick?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Come on.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They hastened out of the main building and to
the garage where the company’s officials kept their
cars. Potter’s runabout was there. “Pile in,” he
said. “Where to?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Cantor’s office.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter shot out of the archway and whirled
down-town through the clear, chilly December air.
He did not stop for corners or traffic officers, but,
keeping his knee against the horn button, gave the
car all he could give it—and Downs clung to his
seat and prayed.</p>

<p class='c004'>They drew up abruptly before the entrance to the
building where Cantor maintained an office, and
sprang out. The elevator carried them to the
seventh floor.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The thing is to get in without scaring whoever
is there,” said Downs. “In this case the papers filed
there are as valuable, more valuable, than the men.
We must give them no time to destroy anything.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Good fortune was with them. As they approached
Cantor’s door a man opened it and was about to step
into the corridor. Downs stepped forward quickly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I beg your pardon,” he said, “but can you tell
me where James W. Rogers’s office is?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The man stood with the door half opened behind
him. “I’m sorry,” he said, “but I never heard the
name.”</p>

<p class='c004'>By that time Downs was within arm’s reach.
He lunged forward, gripped the man, and hurled
him backward through the door. Potter leaped
after them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Shut the door!” snapped Downs from a victor’s
perch on the astounded man’s chest. “Help roll
him over.” The man was turned on his face and
steel circles clinked upon his wrists.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who are you?... What does this mean?”
the man said, furiously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m not sure,” said Downs, “till we take a look-see.
Maybe it’s just an outrage on a respectable
business man. If it is you may expect profuse
apologies.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A huge safe stood open invitingly. Downs
pounced upon it, found it full of little drawers, and
the drawers laden with papers, with card indices
and the like—and all covered with German script.
“Um!...” he said. “Read German?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” said Potter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t. Talk it, but don’t read to speak of.
Have a look.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter unfolded a document, read it, shrugged
his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No apologies needed,” he said to the handcuffed
man. “These,” he said to Downs, “seem to be
reports from agents—reports of their movements.”
He examined a card from an adjoining drawer.
“These are the agents, all neatly indexed, with the
salaries paid,” he said. “The Germans are a systematic
and efficient people.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“They <em>will</em> stick to system,” said Downs, with a
chuckle. “It’s a great labor-saver for us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“When you find the system,” said Potter, with
a chuckle.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We seem to have the whole bag of tricks. The
next thing is to go over this mass of stuff and then
have a general round-up.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Somebody will be calling here, or coming in—and
give the alarm,” said Potter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Anybody who sticks his nose in here leaves it
here,” Downs snapped.</p>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly the man lunged forward toward the wall;
seemed bent upon butting his head against it, upon
grinding his face against it. Potter leaped upon him
and hurled him away from the spot.... On the
wall was an ordinary electric push-button such as
is used to ring a door-bell. What the man had done
was evident. His hands had been manacled behind
him and were useless. He had pressed the button
with his face.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where does that alarm sound?” Downs demanded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Find out,” said the man, sullenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Some efficiency there,” said Potter, ruefully.
“Of course that button was put there for just this
emergency—to give the alarm if anything happened
here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Some other office in this building,” said Downs.
“On a lower floor. That sort of arrangement
wouldn’t extend outside this building. Most likely
the office directly below this.... I can’t leave
this room and this man. You make tracks.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter rushed out of the door and down the stairs,
which were close at hand, by good fortune. As his
feet touched the sixth floor he saw Philip, the chauffeur,
step into an elevator, heard the elevator door
crash shut. He shouted, but it did not stop. The
alarm had reached Philip and Philip was off to spread
the warning.</p>

<p class='c004'>Another elevator was descending. It stopped on
Potter’s signal, and he stepped in. “To the ground
floor—quick. Make no stops. Drop her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The startled elevator conductor obeyed, flung
open the door as he arrived level with the street,
and Potter rushed out. He reached the sidewalk
just in time to see Philip in an automobile, half a
block away. Potter stepped quickly into his own
machine and followed. He had no other thought
but to overtake Philip. Just what he should do
when he overtook him was not a consideration for
that moment. Headlong as usual, he counted no
costs and let each second care for that second’s
concerns. That he had no authority to apprehend
Philip did not trouble him in the least. He believed
he had the physical ability, and that was all he
required.</p>

<p class='c004'>Philip turned east at the Campus and traversed
Cadillac Square to the County building and the
intersection of Congress Street. Out this frayed and
shabby thoroughfare he continued, not with the
speed of one who fancies himself pursued, but as
one travels who is upon important errand. Potter
maintained a position a hundred feet behind and
waited for Philip to stop.</p>

<p class='c004'>Philip did not stop for a dozen blocks. Then he
drew up at the curb before a dingy frame structure
housing one of those hand-to-mouth saloons which
seem to abound in Detroit, saloons which sell enormous
glasses of beer for a nickel, and find difficulty
to make both ends meet, to provide food for the
family and funds to pay the considerable government
license. Into this place Philip hastened.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter was at his heels, stepping into a murky
room reeking with the odor of stale beer, villainous
tobacco, and even more distressing aromas of cookery
not guiltless of the taint of garlic. Three men
occupied the barroom, the bartender, sprawling over
his greasy bar, a stout man dozing in a corner, and
Philip.</p>

<p class='c004'>Upon Potter’s entrance Philip turned and faced
the door, and Potter saw surprised recognition in
his eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, Philip,” said Potter, “I’ve got you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have, eh?” said Philip. “What do you
mean—got me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“When your friend in Cantor’s office pushed the
button,” said Potter, “I tagged along after you.”
He continued to advance.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’s far enough,” Philip said, crouching.
“You tagged along, eh? Well, just tag out of that
door again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Better come along without a row.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you want to keep your health,” said Philip,
crouching, “you’ll beat it and leave me alone.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter turned to the bartender, who no longer
sprawled, but eyed him intently.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This man is a German spy—trying to escape and
warn other spies,” Potter said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No!” said the bartender, with profound astonishment.
“You don’t tell me! Him? Why, I know
him! He hain’t no spy—he’s a chauffeur....
You hain’t no spy, be you, Phil?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Certainly not. This guy is nutty.... Look
here, Mr. Waite, I don’t want you should get hurt.
Take your foot in your hand.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you coming with me?” Potter asked, sharply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not on a Friday. Fridays is unlucky days.”
He did not take his eyes off Potter’s face, but stood
with a pugilist’s crouch, waiting. Potter sprang
toward him, took Philip’s blow upon the side of the
head, and closed in. They grappled, whirled about,
trampling the floor until the glasses behind the bar
danced upon the shelves. Potter was larger, stronger.
He succeeded in lifting Philip from his feet and hurling
him to the floor, but Philip clung to him, forcing
him to sprawl on top of his prisoner. In a moment
of fierce energy Potter was kneeling upon Philip’s
arms and sitting upon his chest.</p>

<p class='c004'>The stout man who had dozed in the corner
shuffled to his feet and approached leisurely.</p>

<p class='c004'>“This man is a spy. Help me tie him,” Potter
panted.</p>

<p class='c004'>“For sure,” said the man, stepping behind Potter.
Then Potter felt something hard jammed against
his ribs. He did not see it, nor could he feel its
shape, but he knew what it was.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What are you doing?” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Vell,” said the stout man, “I t’ink I should take
some interest. I t’ink maybe it iss best if you git
up und leave the young man alone. For sure.
You should get up, und you should <em>shut</em> up. Right
off.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The man’s voice was not raised, not angry or
menacing, rather genial, in fact, but the thing pressed
against Philip’s ribs was not genial. Nor was it an
instrument encouraging one to dispute.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Git up,” the stout man repeated, and Potter
obeyed sullenly.</p>

<p class='c004'>Philip struggled to his feet, scowling. “I told you
to keep out of this,” he said to Potter. “You’re
one of them that won’t take advice. You come
beggin’ for it, and now you’re gettin’ it.... You
boys keep him here an hour—after that I don’t
care what becomes of him.... Then you better
beat it. The government dicks are wise to us.
I guess the circus is over.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“One hour?” said the stout man.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That’ll be plenty.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He will stay—like goot young man,” said the
stout individual, pleasantly. “You go along, mit
nottings to worry.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Philip went first into the rear portion of the house,
where the living quarters of the proprietor had their
location—judging, at least, from the odor of cookery.
He remained five minutes, then reappeared. He had
done the telephoning he had come to do.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t let him make his getaway,” he said, as
he went out of the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I t’ink you should better go in der back room,”
said the stout man, and Potter obeyed reluctantly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How about getting away yourself?” he said.
“Doesn’t that interest you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You should worry. In one hour you can go.
Den I look out for meinself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter sat down in a rickety chair, a very disgusted
young man. He was a blunderer. From the first
he had blundered. And now his blundering promised
to bring all his discoveries to nothing. Cantor
would escape, others, duly warned, would escape—all,
doubtless, to carry on their work elsewhere in
the country. So much for rushing into things headlong....
He wondered what Downs was doing.
There was but one ray of light in the affair—Cantor’s
work was interrupted, his organization broken up.
But that was little when compared to what might
have been accomplished if he had worked with his
intelligence instead of his impulses. It is no pleasant
experience for a young man of Potter’s make-up to
find himself ridiculous, and he felt he was ridiculous—held
a futile prisoner by a stout old German who
seemed to regard the whole thing in a humorous
light. He scowled and applied a well-selected list
of names to himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>He never knew before how long sixty minutes could
be. From time to time his guard peered owlishly
at a fat silver watch and announced the passage of
time.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Vell, we wait fifteen minutes already,” he would
say, or, “Perty soon we keep company halluf an
hour.”</p>

<p class='c004'>At last the hour came to an end; the stout man
replaced his watch in his pocket. “You should go
now if you like,” he said. “I got no more use for
you here, eh? You run along now, und maybe you
keep out of troubles.” Evidently the man did not
take him over-seriously, and it enraged Potter.
The stout man chuckled. “Und don’t worry apout
me, please. Goot-by.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter was accompanied to the door, and the
stout man stood by, his right hand concealing something
in his pocket, until Potter started his car and
drove away. Then he vanished with suddenness.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter was at a loss. How should he proceed now?
Should he go in search of Downs to report his fiasco,
or should he go ahead on some plan of his own?
The lesson he had just received was forgotten. He
had no stomach to see the look that would come over
Downs’s face when he made his report. No, he
would do something. He would not come back
empty-handed. He would not go back until he
had something to show for his afternoon’s work.
He had set out to catch Philip, and he would stick
to it until he did keep Philip. Such are the ways
of head longitude, if one may name it so.</p>

<p class='c004'>The one place Potter could think of where trace
might be had of the man was where he lived—over
Herman von Essen’s garage—and he took that as
his destination. Ten minutes brought his car to
the von Essen driveway and he turned in. His
headlights cut through the dusk to the doors of the
garage, for the short winter afternoon was speeding
toward darkness. As he leaped out of the car he
noted that the house was dark and paused a moment
to peer from one window to another. No light
was visible, and he wondered at it. His objective,
however, was the garage, and he hastened toward it.
The doors were locked. Through the window he
had used the night before he looked in and could
make out the presence of both the von Essen cars.</p>

<p class='c004'>He went to the door that gave on the stairway
leading up to Philip’s quarters, rapped, waited, but
received no answer. He tried the door. It opened
to his turn of the knob, and he climbed the stairs
with what stealth he was capable of. He found no
door locked. No one was in the rooms, which were
in a state of confusion. Their condition was that
of rooms hastily ransacked by a tenant snatching
what was valuable and most convenient in unexpected
flight.</p>

<p class='c004'>He descended and went to the rear door of the
house. No one answered his ring or his knock.
He was beginning to be affected by a sense of strangeness,
by a certain numbing portent which seemed to
weight the very air. The hairs at the back of his
neck felt as though they were striving to stand erect,
as if a chill breeze were touching them. He retreated
from the door and peered at the house, at
its lightless windows, its massive blackness against
the evening sky. It wore a deserted, forbidding,
secretive look; the look of a house concealing
something awful within it.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was alarmed now, and his alarm was for
Hildegarde. What did this thing mean? What did
it mean to her? Where was she?</p>

<p class='c004'>Now he rushed to the front of the house, mounted
the broad piazza and rang the bell long and repeatedly.
Not satisfied with this, he battered the
door with his fists. Suddenly the door opened, and
Hildegarde stood there outlined against the darkness,
a wisp of a thing almost to be blown away by
a breeze, he thought.</p>

<p class='c004'>She uttered a gasp, a sob of relief. “Potter....
I prayed you would come....” She drew him
into the house and closed the door behind him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>“I was alone, alone,” Hildegarde said, tremulously,
“and I was afraid.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The house is dark,” he said, peering about him.
“I could make nobody hear—until you came.
Where are the lights?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Lights!... I was afraid in the dark, but I
dared not light a light.... It would have been
awful to light a light.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you mean? Where are the servants?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know.... Gone.... Let me touch
you. Let me feel your arm.... Come, it’s in here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He felt her pressing against him, sensed the shuddering
of her body as she led him into the library.
“There,” she whispered. “On the floor....
There....”</p>

<p class='c004'>He saw something there, blackly outlined, something
that sprawled grotesquely, offensively, something
that sprawled motionless and horrible. Again
he felt the rising of his hair and the chill of dread,
and hesitated. Then he forced himself to step
forward, to bend over that sprawling black thing,
to light a match. As it flamed Hildegarde uttered
a faint scream.</p>

<p class='c004'>The tiny flame threw a fitful, distorting light on
the man that lay there; made his features grotesque,
appalling. The bulging, staring eyes seemed to be
fastened upon Potter’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“God!...” he exclaimed. “Your father!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“My father,” she repeated.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You were alone with <em>that</em>? Alone in the dark?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was awful!” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He is dead.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dead.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who—who killed him?” Somehow he dreaded
to ask that question.</p>

<p class='c004'>“God!” she said, simply.</p>

<p class='c004'>He stood up, grasped her shoulders with firm
hands. “Pull yourself together,” he said, harshly.
“Don’t go to pieces. What has happened? What
does this mean?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m not going to pieces. I’m calm—but I’m
frightened.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter switched on the lights and bent over von
Essen, examining him to find what had struck him
down.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is no wound,” he said, lifting his face.
“How did he die?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Because,” she said, quietly, “one of us had to
die. God chose him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He fancied he caught a note of joy in her voice;
it startled him, repelled him, so unnatural did it
seem.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Such a father,” she went on with unnatural calm.
“His blood was my blood—but I hated him. His
touch, the air he breathed, was defilement. I
could not have borne it another day.... He <em>had</em>
to die.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hildegarde!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You think I’m heartless. You think I ought
to cry.... Oh, I could sing! I’m free at last.
Free of him, free of his defilement. If I could only
get his blood out of my veins....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What are you saying? What has been going
on here? Tell me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He was a spy and a traitor and a murderer....
I discovered it. I knew it—and I couldn’t denounce
him. He was my father, don’t you see? My father!...
You can’t betray your father to the police.
I hated him for it, and I loved my country—but
I couldn’t denounce him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your father a spy? A German agent?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This explained much. He fell silent, striving to
comprehend something of the tortures she had
endured, striving to picture the life she must have
led. “You poor child!” he said, softly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“When you came with questions—I couldn’t
answer. You called me a traitor ... and I dared
not tell you. He was my father and—and I couldn’t
have lived to have people point to me and call me
the daughter of a traitor. Could you have borne
that?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” he said. “No.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He knew I had discovered what he was....
He locked me in. I’ve been watched day and night.
I’ve been a prisoner.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Cantor?...”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Was a guard. I couldn’t explain <em>that</em>....
He wanted me to marry him—to go with him without
marriage—and father tried to force me.... He
was trying to force me to-day.... And he died.”
Suddenly she clutched his arm. “Oh,” she cried,
“be quick! Do something!... They were warned!...
I did it. I called Cantor Adolf von Arnheim.
I had to do something to protect myself....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What did he say? Was it true?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was true. It changed him. He forgot me....
He told father he must strike at once—to-night....
It’s going to be to-night. Somehow,
by some means, he’s going to do some awful thing.
He rushed out.... Then Philip’s wife came with
a note ... and when father read it he ... died.
It killed him....”</p>

<p class='c004'>“To-night. Cantor is going to do something
to-night. What? What else do you know?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let me think. It was all so terrible....
He has an aeroplane. He is going to blow up
factories and channels. In an hour. He said he
could do it all in an hour.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where is Cantor? Where did he go?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In his car. I don’t know where he went—it
was that way”—she pointed—“away from the city....
He said it would be easy, that there was no
way to stop him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That way? Toward the lake?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter stood motionless, thinking as he had never
thought before, sometimes thinking aloud.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He has Matthews’s ’plane,” he said. “He’ll
use that—to drop explosives.... He’s been gone
hours. He can’t be caught and stopped. Once he
reaches that ’plane, there’s no way to stop him.
Even if the city was warned, he could do as he
wished.... There’s no way to stop him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But you must stop him.... If this thing is
done it will be my fault—mine!... Because I
didn’t tell.... But now I’ve told.... Oh, Potter,
you must do something.... I’m not a traitor....
I love my country. Don’t let me be blamed
for this. There’s a way to prevent it—some way....
You must find it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If we knew where the ’plane was—or the explosive
stored.” He stopped suddenly, and a surge
of joy welled up to his eyes. “I know,” he said.
“I know where he must start.... That island,
Hildegarde, where we fell.... That’s what the
island was for. They made explosive, stored explosive....
There is where he will start.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What time is it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He looked at his watch. “Nearly six,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He won’t start for hours—until midnight.
He’ll be safest then.... Can’t you get there in
time?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t think a motor-boat could reach that
island—the ice in the lake.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“<em>He’s</em> got to reach it. <em>He</em> can reach it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’ll have that ’plane hidden on the lake shore.
He’ll fly across and take on his explosives.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have an aeroplane, too,” she said, simply.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a thought brightly gleaming in the darkness;
it was a thought which fitted that man and
girl like a garment skilfully made. It called to them
and beckoned with its recklessness, the adventure
of it, its audacity, its quality of knight-errantry.
To be a knightly champion of his country, riding a
steed of the air in the lists of the heavens! That
was indeed an enterprise in tune with the soul of
Potter Waite, in tune with the not less turbulent
soul of Hildegarde von Essen.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thank you,” he said, presently, his voice vibrant.
“It’s worth a try.... I’m sorry,” he said, slowly,
“that I didn’t know, didn’t understand. I must
have hurt you. I wouldn’t have hurt you for worlds....
Last night I called you a traitor. If saying I
am sorry—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“How could you know?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If only the rest—that other thing—were a lie,
too.” He ground his teeth, turned from her suddenly.
“Good-by,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“To get my ’plane ready.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And me? Are you going to leave me here alone—with
<em>him</em>?” She motioned toward Herman von
Essen. “Oh, you mustn’t!... I can’t stay! Take
me with you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” he said, “you can’t stay here.... Where
can I take you? Minutes are precious.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Anywhere—away from here.... I don’t care.
Don’t waste time with me.... Let me go with
you—to the hangar. I’ll be all right there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Get your wraps.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She ran out of the room and up the stairs. As
she opened her wardrobe door she hesitated an instant—there
was only an instant of doubt. Then,
quickly, deftly, wasting not a second, she removed
her cumbering skirts and clad herself in those riding-breeches
which she had worn that day so long ago—the
day when she had stamped herself on Potter’s
heart as a fairy prince.... She knew what she
purposed.... Next she donned a fur-lined coat
and driving-cap that covered her ears. She was not
calm now, but she was very eager. A tinge of pink
appeared in her pallid cheeks. By a little the weight
of horror was shifted from her heart, shifted by hope.</p>

<p class='c004'>Perhaps she was a trifle hysterical; perhaps the
long strain with its sudden tragic climax had tried
her until she could not see clearly, think straight
from cause to effect. But hope had dawned, a hope
that, perhaps, has dawned in the hearts of many
whose guilt was more real than hers. She had
seen a vision. In that vision she had bought herself
free—free from guilt and free from defilement.</p>

<p class='c004'>She descended to Potter. He turned low the light
in the library, leaving Herman von Essen where
he lay. Hildegarde stood in the door an instant,
looking down at the thing that had been her father,
drew a deep, gulping breath, and, covering her face,
suffered Potter to lead her away.</p>

<p class='c004'>Neither spoke as the car sped them to the hangar.
It was dark, unoccupied. Potter unlocked the door
and threw it open for Hildegarde to enter. In
an instant he found the switch and turned on the
lights.... Before them brooded Potter’s newest
aeroplane, wings spread as though something found
shelter beneath them. Hildegarde spoke of that.
“Like a mother chicken,” she said, pointing,
“protecting her brood.... What a brood she is
protecting to-night!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You must help,” he said, sharply. “Throw off
your coat.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She did so, stood revealed as she had stood revealed
that other day, that bountiful spring day.
Potter shut his eyes. “Why?” he said, “why—”</p>

<p class='c004'>She did not answer, and he stood, eyes open now,
staring at her. His lips were white, straight, compressed.
His throat ached.... How could that
thing be true which she had confessed?... Every
line of her proclaimed it a lie. The slenderness,
the grace, the piquancy and boyish beauty of her
asserted her purity, her chastity. He groaned....
They lied. In her nature had created a lie....</p>

<p class='c004'>He tore away his eyes, began to work with feverish
energy, ordering Hildegarde here, ordering her there,
and she obeyed quietly, intelligently. Potter tested
struts and braces, wires and fastenings, controls
and motor. He saw to it there were gasolene and
lubricant—as far as was in his power he saw to it
that his steed of the air should be at its best, potent
to give the most that could be demanded of it
that night. He looked at his watch.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nearly ten,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is it time to start?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What will you do? How will you find him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll sit down on the road he must follow,” Potter
said. “I’ll blockade his island. He won’t get
past me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In the darkness—”</p>

<p class='c004'>He pointed through the window. The moon had
arisen, silver-cold, gleaming with the rays of a frozen
fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Potter—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m going with you.... That is why I wore
these clothes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nonsense!” he said, sharply.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ve got to buy myself free,” she said, intensely.
“Can’t you understand?... I’ve done wrong....
I was almost a traitor to my country—that I <em>loved</em>.
I knew, and I was afraid to tell. I knew her enemies
and her traitors—and I knew what they were
attempting to do—but I was afraid to tell.... But
I <em>did</em> tell, when it was almost too late.... I’m
guilty, Potter. It will be with me always, accusing
me, if you don’t let me go.... You must
see.... There’ll be danger to-night. I must be
in danger. I must risk something, everything.
I must show that I am willing to die for my country....
Don’t you understand now? I must be willing
to offer myself—and I must offer myself.... It’s
a ransom.... Then I can come back—if I do come
back—and go away and have <em>peace</em>.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She stopped, drew nearer to him by a step, and let
her eyes plead with him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Like was pleading with like. Her soul called to a
soul that was its complement, its counterpart. It
could not but understand. Normal considerations
failed; nothing about their situation was normal.
Potter himself was uplifted, breathing an ether finer,
more rarified, more exhilarating than air.... He
was not a plodding man of the workaday world that
night, but an eager, restless, headlong-questing soul
of high adventure.... He understood her; her
mood was clear to him. Why should he refuse to
her soul what he was demanding for his own?</p>

<p class='c004'>He bent over her and kissed her, not with the kiss
of a lover, but with the kiss of an ascetic. “Come,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>She thanked him silently. “Now?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>He nodded.</p>

<p class='c004'>Together they opened the wide doors. In another
moment there burst upon them the thunderous
roar of the powerful motor, <em>his</em> motor, his country’s
motor that was to carry her to victory in her battle
to free the world from hideous blackness.</p>

<p class='c004'>He helped her to her seat, and mounted to his
own. In another moment they were moving out
upon their quest.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>They mounted swiftly into the face of the
moon, higher, ever higher. Beneath them lay
a cold world making ready for sleep. Behind them
glowed the lights of the city, of the city going about
its affairs, unconscious of the calamity that threatened.
Richly gowned men and women occupied
theater chairs; cafés, restaurants with their gaudy
cabarets, were preparing to receive their guests.
Lights were blinking out in the homes of working-men
and of millionaire as the inmates retired, conscious
of security, for the night. In many homes
were dancing and gaiety; in other homes—a scattering
few—nightly family prayers were being said. As
on any other nights, the down-town streets were quick
with moving motor-cars, or black with automobiles
parked and waiting until their owners should issue
from theater, from club, from innocent amusement,
or from squalid place of license and artificial joy.</p>

<p class='c004'>Detroit lay spread out in great panorama, sleeping,
spending, each inhabitant flying high or flying
low, according to his means and his desires ... all
defenseless against the thing that threatened; defenseless
save for that frail craft of the air that
mounted and mounted on fragile wings until it was
but a speck against the illuminated heavens!</p>

<p class='c004'>Steadily, swiftly it sped to take its place as
sentinel at those high gates; to bar the roads of the
sky; to ride the clouds a challenger, a champion, a
winged guardian, steadfast, courageous, eagerly
dauntless....</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter felt the splendor of it; it uplifted him.
Soaring there above the lake, he knew a strange
sense of detachment from the fetters of the flesh.
He felt, not like a man, liable to weaknesses, ills,
death, but like an immortal upon a mission for
Olympus. He was not afraid of the issue. He was
confident. His exhilaration was not of the sort that
makes men shout and sing; it was as if some great,
glowing dignity rested upon him, to be worn with
worthiness. The fate of a city was in his hands, and
he rejoiced to have it there....</p>

<p class='c004'>On he flew, steadily mounting as to some appointed
watch-tower. He would mount to a height
from which his view would be limited only by the
power of his eyes. Nothing could move upon that
lake, or in the air above that lake, that could escape
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>He rejoiced in his motor. It did not falter, it was
<em>true</em>; if great events must depend upon a tiny
mechanism, then this mechanism was worthy of the
responsibility.... Almost alone he had created it
and given it to his country. It was right that he
should be proud.</p>

<p class='c004'>He hovered and circled, his eyes ever toward that
distant island, ever watching, vigilant. Hildegarde
sat as vigilant as he, as thrilled as he. She was
almost happy.... How distant seemed the squalid
events of her life, the tragedy of the day! She, too,
was an immortal, experiencing the privileges of immortality.
Her heart was high, her soul was confident.
It was a better, a greater thing than mere
happiness....</p>

<p class='c004'>The night was still, clear, cold. Ten thousand feet
above the earth the cold was indescribable; it gnawed
through their garments, froze the very moisture in
their eyes, yet, somehow, they were glad to endure it;
to endure was part of the service demanded of them....
So they hovered and watched....</p>

<p class='c004'>Hildegarde touched Potter’s arm and pointed.
His eyes had seen it too—that speck against the
luminous dome of the sky. They watched it, uncertain
if it were the thing they awaited....
Potter shut off his motor, and the stillness left them
aghast. It was unreal, uncanny.... They listened.
Faintly, a shade this side of inaudibility, was wafted
to them a rhythmic splutter, growing stronger,
stronger.... It told its story.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again the roar of the motor engulfed them, and
Potter swerved toward the oncoming speck, flying
high, maintaining a position thousands of feet above
his unsuspecting prey. Presently the other aeroplane
became distinct, a black silhouette, the ghost
of an aeroplane traversing a worldless sky....
On it came. But Potter knew he was rushing to
meet it with twice the speed of its own approach....
He had not been seen. The roar of Cantor’s
motor concealed the fury of Potter’s machine.
Now Cantor was below them, almost directly below
them.... The moment had arrived!</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter turned his nose downward, swooping like
a preying eagle, and as he volplaned he swerved.
He was flying on a level with Cantor’s machine,
approaching it from the rear. Hildegarde saw the
blue shape of a revolver in Potter’s hand and bent
forward, tense, breathless for the event.</p>

<p class='c004'>Cantor, unconscious that he did not occupy the
heavens alone, sped onward with singleness of
purpose. He was unaware of danger, unconscious
of near-flying menace. Potter did not want it so.
He could not attack a man, an unconscious man,
from behind. What he wanted was combat, man
to man conflict. Even a spy bent on treacherous
mission of destruction he could not destroy without
warning.</p>

<p class='c004'>Swiftly his ’plane drew alongside Cantor’s machine,
passed it, and as it passed Potter looked at
his adversary, saw his wide eyes fixed upon him
with unbelieving astonishment. Then Cantor was
left behind.</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter mounted, turned, approached again.
Flashes of fire spat out from Cantor’s machine,
bullets droned harmlessly by.... It was as Potter
wished it. He did not fire himself. He was not
ready yet, but passed Cantor, circled again and came
up from the rear. He was capable, he knew, of
circling Cantor’s machine. For every mile Cantor
could traverse Potter traversed two.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now he drew to a position at the side of Cantor’s
’plane again, wing-tip almost touching wing-tip.
He could see Cantor’s face distorted by rage and
apprehension; saw Cantor lift his arm, saw the spurt
of fire from his revolver. The bullet plowed
through Potter’s coat behind his shoulders....
Almost simultaneously he answered the fire with his
automatic, once, twice, thrice.... He turned in
his seat as he passed, but Cantor was still erect, his
machine still under control.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again he repeated the maneuver. Again Cantor
fired at point-blank range—and missed. Once
more Potter’s automatic spluttered.... Cantor
lurched forward, his machine veered, seemed to
wabble in the air—and Potter sped away, mounting,
circling. As he returned he saw Cantor’s machine
careening crazily; saw it dip, plunge, tip
perilously with no intelligence to hold it in control....
Then, suddenly, it pointed its nose downward
and plunged.... Potter held his breath.
He found himself counting, “One—two—three—four—five—six—”</p>

<p class='c004'>Not like an arrow, not like a plummet, but like
a weighted leaf, the aeroplane fell.... Potter
leaned far over to watch. Hildegarde, awed in the
face of this happening, peered over also, fascinated....
The ’plane seemed to merge with the earth—with
the ice of the lake. Then there was a mighty
burst of flame, a gigantic, cataclysmic sound which
dwarfed the roar of the motor; which seemed to
tear the very air into shreds and to threaten to
rock the moon in its distant sky.... Potter’s
machine rocked and dipped as the blast of air surged
upward.... It righted itself and moved onward,
smoothly, peacefully—the sole occupant of the sky.</p>

<p class='c004'>The bombs with which Cantor had meant to devastate
a city had let loose their awful force ... harmlessly
to the sleeping city.... There would be no
need to look for Cantor, for Cantor’s ’plane. They
had vanished, been snuffed out by that awful force,
wiped clean from existence as if they had never
been.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a homing flight now, back to a city saved
from a peril of which it had been unconscious, of
which the major part of it might forever remain
unconscious. The thing was done; the high gates
had not been forced; the winged guardian had
blocked the roars of the sky....</p>

<p class='c004'>They were descending now, nearing their place of
alighting.... Potter, thankful for the moonlight,
pointed for the field, the earth leaped up to meet
them, touched them, they bounded along its frozen
surface....</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter lifted Hildegarde from her place, carried
her into the hangar, himself stiff, aching with the
cold. She lay quiet in his arms, her eyes closed, but
she was not unconscious; she was keenly conscious.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I saw it,” she said, her voice a breath. “I was
there. I was a part of it.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Potter lighted a fire quickly and carried Hildegarde
before it. He chafed her hands, compelled
her to remove her boots, and chafed her feet—and
she suffered him to attend her in silence....
She was at peace. She had offered herself, had
shared the risks, had almost felt the wind of bullets
that passed.... The ways of the human mind are
not wholly to be understood. The thing she had
done might not have satisfied another, yet she was
satisfied. She had paid her ransom, bought her
redemption.... She was at peace, and to be at
peace was good ... good.</p>

<p class='c004'>She sat on a chair; Potter knelt beside her. She
smiled down at his head; her fingers reached out to
touch his hair.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Potter....” she said, softly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Garde....”</p>

<p class='c004'>He was looking up into her face now with eyes
that glowed, glowed with the pride of success, with
the happiness that comes only from the consciousness
of a great service performed worthily.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How proud you should be!” she said, gently.
“How proud the country will be of you!... To
love one’s country—and to be able to do a great
thing for one’s country....”</p>

<p class='c004'>The spirit of the high places was still upon them;
they could not think small thoughts, speak puny
words. For a time they sat in silence. Then Potter
spoke:</p>

<p class='c004'>“I knew—up there—that you should never leave
me,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>She acquiesced; it was a thing that had come to
her as well.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Never,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We were created for each other.... Nothing
could hold us apart.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can anything be greater than love?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I believe there is something—something that
selects a man and woman and brings them together....
We have been brought together.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I felt it—to-night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Again silence fell. Her hand rested on his head—it
was the only contact of their bodies.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hildegarde,” he said, presently, “there is a thing
I must mention this once—and then never again.
It must never arise between us, in your heart or in
my heart.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is it, Potter?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You confessed to me once—here in this room—”
He hesitated, sought for words in which to clothe
the thing, words that would carry no bitterness, no
accusation, none of the horror the fact had brought
to him. “You said you loved me, but could marry
no man.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, I said it,” she replied.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Was it true?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was true—then.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then?... It is not true now?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is not true now.... I was defiled.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That was the word.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“God had burned away the defilement.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He groped for her meaning; it was hidden from
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was <em>his</em> blood in my veins—the blood of a man
who could betray his country.... It defiled me.
He was my father, and the fact defiled me. He was
loathsome to me, but my life came from him....
How could I marry any man? Could I hand on such
an inheritance to the innocent?”</p>

<p class='c004'>His heart seemed to stop. Did he hear aright?
Was this the defilement and the manner of her defilement?
He could have cried aloud with joy, for
she was as he had thought her. Looking into her
face, into her eyes, he had been unable to believe—but
the fact of her confession had daunted him....
And <em>this</em> was her confession....</p>

<p class='c004'>A doubt came. The matter must be placed beyond
all doubtings. He believed he understood, but
now he must know.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your father’s death—” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I knew God had seen and had taken the matter
into His hands. I saw the punishment.... I knew
I was free.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But Cantor?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Cantor?” It was her turn to be puzzled.
“What has he to do with it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“With your—defilement?”</p>

<p class='c004'>She did not comprehend; thank God she did not
comprehend ... she should never comprehend;
never know the black, sordid thing he had believed
of her.... He was on his knees before her, his head
bowed on her knees.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Forgive me,” he said, unsteadily. “Forgive
me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Forgive you?... For what, Potter?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“For being only human—with a man’s understanding—when
I should have known what no man
could have known.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She laughed softly. “I can forgive <em>that</em>,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>They were warm flesh and blood again; two
human beings, man and woman, with human love
calling the one to the other. He held out his arms
toward her and she came into them, lips pressed
lips, and heart beat against heart.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I was wrong,” he said, presently. “There’s
nothing like love.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Like our love,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>After a long time he put her away from him gently.
“We must go,” he said. “There are things to be
done.... I will take you to mother again, and this
time you will stay.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll make her keep me,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your father—I will attend to what must be
done.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What moments we have had in this room!” he
said, looking about him lingeringly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Bitter and sweet,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There shall be no more bitter—only sweet.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It will be the sweeter,” she said, with knowledge
born of experience.</p>

<p class='c004'>They went out reluctantly. He placed her in
his car and they drove toward his home—their
home now.... The house was ablaze with lights.
Two cars stood at the curb. Potter entered the
driveway, wondering, stopped at the door and
alighted. Side by side he entered with Hildegarde.</p>

<p class='c004'>His father stood in the hall in hat and coat, fresh
from the street.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Dad!” said Potter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Son!... Son, where have you been? What
has happened? We’ve hunted for you—Downs
has hunted for you.... We thought—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where’s mother, Dad?... I want to take—my
wife—to her.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your wife? Is that what you’ve been doing?
Getting married?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not getting married—getting the wife.... We
will be married—”</p>

<p class='c004'>“In good time,” said Hildegarde, gravely.</p>

<p class='c004'>Downs appeared in the door of the library, came
forward eagerly. “Waite, I’m glad to see you.
I’m relieved. We were afraid they had you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter wanted to ask questions, not to answer
them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What have you done? Have you got them?
Did they get away?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We had a mighty successful round-up,” Downs
said, “and those papers were worth their weight
in diamonds.... We smashed the organization,
smashed it flat.... But the man Cantor got away.
There’s not a trace of him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” said Potter, soberly, “Cantor did not get
away.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s that? Where is he?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let <em>me</em> tell you,” said Hildegarde. “Potter
won’t tell it as it ought to be told.” She took up the
story, told it vividly, feelingly, so that her hearers
saw the things she saw, experienced the things she
had experienced, and as she continued Downs and
Fabius Waite looked at Potter as at a stranger suddenly
set among them, some stranger worthy of
deference, of something like awe.</p>

<p class='c004'>“So,” finished Hildegarde, “Potter met him in the
air—and shut the highway to him.... And that
was Cantor’s end.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Son,” said Fabius Waite, his words vibrant with
pride, “I can’t say what I feel.... I’m proud—proud....
The whole country will be proud.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The country mustn’t know,” said Potter, looking
at Downs.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Until the war is done,” said Downs. “But
there are those who shall know.... My report
will go to them. I think you may count on the
thanks, the gratitude of the man who lives in the
White House.... It was a big job, well done.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can you wait, Downs? I want to take Hildegarde
to mother. There’s something I must arrange
with you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hildegarde need not have feared for her welcome,
not after Potter’s mother looked into her face and
heard her say, “This time, Mrs. Waite, I can tell
you that I love him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Potter hastened back to Downs. “Did those
papers name Herman von Essen?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He is dead.... I found him dead on his library
floor. That girl was his daughter—she’s going to
be my wife.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I understand. You’re entitled to some reward,
Mr. Waite, and this is a small one. No one shall
ever know. His record will be clean.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thank you,” Potter said. “I’m tired....
Good night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good night,” said the Secret Service man, and
he stood looking after Potter until the young man
disappeared up the stairs. “That,” he said to
himself, “is America....”</p>
